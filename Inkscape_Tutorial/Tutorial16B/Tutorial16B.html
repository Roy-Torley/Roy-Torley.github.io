      Effects offer the graphic designer a way to draw hair, fur, and other
      objects that need to appear as a series of wavy curves. By combining
      sub-path stitching, envelope deformation, lattice deformation, and
      sub-path interpolation, the artist can draw areas where the filaments of
      hair and fur, and the threads of textiles add texture, depth, and
      attractive detail to the composition of a piece of artwork.</p>

<section>
  <p>This tutorial is the second part of a two-part tutorial series. In this
  part, Tutorial 16, Part B, we will focus on the <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>
  Live Path Effect to draw hair. We will also use the <b>Envelope
  Deformation</b> and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> Live Path Effects to refine the
  overall shapes of areas of hair and create the smooth flow of hair that is
  trained into a ponytail.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following techniques:</p>
  <ul type = "disc">
    <li>draw curves that fill the space between two parallel or sub-parallel
    boundary curves.
    </li>
    <li>refine the shape of a multi-curve object using envelope deformation
    and lattice deformation tools.
    </li>
    <li>Use transparency and color blending to create a sense of hair depth.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this tutorial, you will continue learning how to draw hair. You will be
  working with three <b>Live Path Effects</b>. <b>Interpolate Sub-paths</b> is
  a live-path function with which you draw two starting lines or curves, called
  <i>sub-paths</i> that define the sides of a space that you intend to fill with
  lines the run parallel to one side sub-path and, as they cross the intervening
  space, they morph in curvature until they mimic the sub-path on the other side
  of the fill space.</p>
  <p>For more information about <b>Live Path Effects</b>, go to Help &gt;
  Inkscape Manual &gt; 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs), and click on <b>Stitch
  Sub-Paths</b> or <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/Tutorial16B_end.svg"><b>Tutorial16B_end.svg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>File &gt; Open file <b>Tutorial16B_end.svg</b>. This file displays a
    completed illustration of a young woman with a ponytail, facing away from
    the viewer.</p>
    <p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to reduce the view of
    the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen
    as you work. (Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to select and move the artwork
    where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the
    image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
    </li>

  <p><b>Resource:</b> For an illustration of the finished artwork in this
  tutorial, see the top of this page.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If you have worked on Tutorial 16, Part A, then File &gt; Open file
  <b>Ponytail.svg</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If, however, you have not worked on Tutorial 16, Part A, then download
  the art file <a href =
  "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/Tutorial16B_start.svg"><b>Tutorial16B_start.svg</b></a>

</ol>
  <p>The art file contains the image of a young woman facing away from the
  camera. The image is on two layers: the bottom layer, which is locked,
  contains the woman as a mannequin figure; the second layer contains hair
  and right ear.</p>

    upper layer.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>The hair is divided into separate areas. Each area contains hair whose flow
  has its own starting and ending points, degree of curvature, color and
  gradient shading. Each area has its own place in the overall image stack
  to create a sense of hair design as might be done in a salon.</p>

    areas of hair" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Exploded view of the different areas of hair.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The woman&rsquo;s ear is its own grouped object so that it can be placed
  between two bodies of hair to enhance the sense of a 3-D presentation.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Ear.gif" alt = "Image of the mannequin's right ear"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Image of the mannequin&rsquo;s right ear.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The task of this tutorial is to create overlays that you will place
  ontop of the areas of hair to create the look of strands of trained hair
  that follow the curvature of each area. The coloration of underlying areas
  and overlying hair filaments will be different to give the appearance of
  darker hair underneath that is not reached by the light, and lighter-colored,
  variegated hair that is reflecting light. The combination colors and styles of
  coloration produce subtle depth.</p>

    <h2>Review of <i>Stitch Sub-Paths</i> and <i>Envelope Deformation</i> Live
    Path Effects in Drawing Hair on the Nape of the Neck</h2>
  </header>
  <p>If you have been taking a break away from Inkscape for a while, it might
  be worthwhile to refresh your memory on the Live Path Effects that you have
  learned in the previous half of this tutorial (Tutorial 16, Part A). In this
  section, you will draw the hair that runs down the back of the model&rsquo;s
  neck in a triangular shape using the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect.
  In subsequent sections, we will focus on learning and using the <b>Sub-Path
  Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), select the reddisn-brown triangular
    shape that represents hair on the nape of the model&rsquo;s neck.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Nape01.gif" alt = "Selecting the neck hair line"

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the area of hair selected, choose Edit &gt; Duplicate to
    duplicate the object and move it to one side of the artwork.</p>

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen
    tool icon" width = "26">), draw two sub-paths that will define the left
    and right sides of a stitch-path live path effect object. Draw them in
    the same direction, that is, from down to up or vice versa. If you draw
    them in opposite directions, the stitch paths will criss-cross, producing
    an effect that you do not want.</p>

    five stitch paths that are four pixels wide. Five is the default number of
    paths when you apply <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> for the first time to a
    combined path object. Your lines might have a different width and color.</p>
    <p>We gave the lines a yellow stroke so that they can be seen easily because

    <h2>Drawing the Right Side-Bang and Back Bang Using the <i>Sub-Path
    Interpolation</i> Live Path Effect</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Drawing using the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect is
  similar to drawing with the <b>Stitching Sub-Path</b> function. The steps
  you take to draw are exactly the same as those for stitching sub-paths. The
  two differences are that lines are drawn parallel or sub-parallel to the two
  edge sub-paths and that there is no randomizing option to introduce
  unevenness in line spacing and length.</p>
  <p>In this section, you will draw the right side-bang and back bang (my
  terminology) for the model using <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Preparing the two sub-paths for the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b>
    Live Path Effect is done in exactly the same way as for
    <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>.</p>
    <p>With the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool
    icon" width = "26">), draw two sub-paths (here, yellow is a great color to
    use because of its contrast to the background coloration) that will be the
    top and bottom limits of the space that the hairs will occupy. They
    don&rsquo;t need to be exact; they just need to provide a starting point
    for the eventual geometry of the sidebang. Note that the upper sub-path
    is drawn so that it lies ontop of the hair object you drew in Tutorial 16,
    Part A. The reason for this placement is that the sidebang will look like
    it comes out from underneath the larger hair object when you are finished.
    Right now, you just need to see the starting layout.</p>
    <p>The lines here are 4 pixels wide so you can see them easily. They will
    remain as boundary lines when you apply <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Sidebang01.gif" alt = "Rough drawing of the top and
        bottom limits of the sidebang shape" class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Rough drawing of the top and bottom limits of the sidebang
        shape.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will create a bend in the left side of the lower sub-path to
    simulate hair that is pulled back behind the top of the ear.</p>
    <p>Make the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node
    tool icon" width = "26">) active and double-click on the bottom of the lower
    sub-path to add a new node there.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Sidebang02.gif" alt = "Adding a node to the lower
        sub-path" class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Adding a node to the lower sub-path.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the left end-node of the lower sub-path to activate it.
    When its directional handle appears, move it directly to the right to
    create a bend in the sub-path that conforms to the curvature of the upper
    part of the ear. Adjust the directional handles of the node that you just
    added to micro-adjust the curvature if you desire.</p>

        the lower path" class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Adjusting the curvature of the lower path.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now that the sub-paths have been drawn to satisfaction, you need to
    prepare them for sub-path interpolation.</p>
    <p>&lt;Shift&gt;-click both sub-paths to group-select them. You&rsquo;ll
    see that each one has its own bounding box.</p>

  <p>You have learned how to draw hair using Live Path Effects. You now have
  a feel for how to use <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Interpolate
  Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b>
  to draw, to make major and minor adjustments to, and to add a natural look to
  human hair. Hair, fur, cloth, and other materials that are made up of fibers,
  short and long, can be imitated with these drawing tools. Live Path Effect
  tools are indeed sophisticated in their complexity, and yet this complexity
  allows you to draw things that are naturally complex in nature.</p>
  <p>Gradient, tranparency, and color blending tools are great supplementary
  and complementary aids in creating a feeling of depth where, the deeper you
  go, the less light gets through to places underneath an illuminated and yet
  open surface.</p>
  <p>Continue to explore these tools with different starting models, lighting,
  and shapes to create something that looks remarkably close to reality, either
  as we know it or as you would like to see it!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What is the primary distinction between <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>,
    <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice
    Deformation</b>?
    </li>
    <li>What tools are available for you to add depth to hair, fur, or cloth?

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p><b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> and <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b> allow you
    to determine how to draw and then actually draw the strands of hair, fur,
    or threads of cloth that make up the foundation of that facet of your
    artwork.</p>
    <p><b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> allow you to
    shape and reshape the envelope that encompasses the body of hair, fur, or
    cloth so that the entire geometry of the shape conforms with your concept.
    The strands or filaments have to be drawn already in order for Envelope
    Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> to mold them into what you
    envision.<p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>Linear gradient</b>, <b>Radial gradient</b>,
    <b>Transparency/Opacity</b>, and color <b>Blend mode</b> tools are available
    to help you give depth, shading, illumination, iridescence, and fine
    texturing produced by an external light source (internal light sources is
    not explored in this particular tutorial).</p>
