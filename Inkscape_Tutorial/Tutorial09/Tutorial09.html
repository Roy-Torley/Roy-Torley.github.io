<p class = "lead">One of the most powerful features of Inkscape is the ability
to use type as a graphic element. Like other objects, type can be painted,
scaled, rotated, and so on. You can also wrap type around objects, make it
follow along the shape of a path, create type masks, import text files into
containers, and modify the shapes of individual letters in a block of type.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll create a T&rsquo;ai Chi lecture series
  poster. You will need to have the Chaparral Pro font installed in your system.
  Chaparral Pro is an OpenType&reg; font that can be
  used on both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. You can download it
  from here as a zipped package of Chaparral Pro font faces <a href =
  "chaparral-pro.zip">Chaparral Pro font</a>, or from a font site on the Web,
  such as <a href = "https://www.wfonts.com/font/chaparral-pro">Wfonts</a> or
  <a href = "https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/chaparral-pro">Cufon Fonts</a>.<p>

    <h2>Adding Type to a Document</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can add type into an Inkscape document in different ways. You can type
  directly into the artwork, copy and paste type from other documents, and
  import entire text files.</p>

  <p>To begin adding type to your artwork, you&rsquo;ll type the Tai Chi title
  on the poster.<p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Select the Text tool (<img src = "images/TextTool.gif" alt = "Text
    tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox. The Select tool cursor changes to the
    Text tool cursor (<img src = "images/TextToolCursor.gif" alt = "Text tool
    cursor" width = "26">). Position the Text tool cursor so that the center
    of the cross hair is in the top left corner of the artwork.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/TextToolCursorPositioned.gif" alt = "Text tool
      positioned" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Text tool cursor positioned at intersection of guide
      lines.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create a text box by clicking and dragging down and to the right
    using the guides that already exist in the document, then release.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The center of the Text tool cursor cross line marks the drawing center
    of the tool.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click to set the type baseline and type <b>T&rsquo;ai Chi</b>. Note
    that a small guide square appears at the bottom left of the <b>T</b>,
    marking the start of the baseline of the text.</p>

    </li>
    <p>By default, the type you create is 12-point sans-serif, filled with
    black, and stroked with None. The Fill and Stroke boxes in the toolbox
    (in the lower left corner of the working window) display the type&rsquo;s
    current paint attributes.</p>

      <h2>Applying Attributes of One Body of Text to Another</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Now, you&rsquo;ll apply attributes of other text in the poster to
    the title text.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>With the Text tool active, click on the line &ldquo;Lecture Series
    300&rdquo;. Note that the text font is 18 point Chaparral Pro bold
    italic.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">

    the Commands Bar (<img src = "images/FillAndStrokeIcon.gif" alt = "Fill and
    Stroke icon" width = "26">). Click on the Fill tab if it is not
    highlighted. Note that the text fill is 60% gray (<b>K</b> for blac<b>k</b>
    is <b>60</b> on the <b>K</b> color bar.).</p>

    80% gray is <b>888888</b>. The two <b>ff</b>s represent 100% opacity.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now click on the title text <b>T&rsquo;ai Chi</b> to select it,
    double-click on the hexadecimal color code to highlight it, press
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the new color code in from the Clipboard, and
    press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the value. The title text has the same gray color
    as the course subheader.</p>

    value determines how transparent (or conversely, how opaque) an object is.
    A value of <b>00</b> means that an object is fully transparent, while a
    value of <b>ff</b> means fully opaque.</p>
    </aside>
    <li><p>Click on the <b>Text and Font</b> icon (<img src = "images/TextAndFontIcon.gif"
    alt = "Text and Font Icon" width = "26">) in the Commands Bar. Locate
    and choose the <b>Chaparral Pro</b> font in the <b>Font family</b> dropdown

    <h2>Creating Type Paths</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can modify the shapes of individual letters in a block of type by
  converting the block to type paths or letterforms. When you create type paths,
  each character becomes a separate object with compound paths outlining the
  character. This is helpful when creating logos or other artwork that is
  distributed to many people and might not have the same fonts that you
  used.</p>
  <p>Now you will create the number 300 and convert it into paths.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the Text tool (<img src = "images/TextTool.gif" alt = "Text
    tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox. Position the cursor and click on a
    spot to the right of the filled rectangle in the upper right section of the
    page. You will start typing here.</p>

    <h2>Creating Type Masks</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Masks crop part of an image so that only a portion of it is revealed
  through the shape or shapes that you create. You can use type as a mask
  without having to convert the type to outlines first.</p>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll create a mask using type and an embedded
  bitmap image. An image of a cloudy sky was pasted into the document to use as
  the background of the mask.</p>
  <p>You will add the heading "ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAM" in the top right corner
  of the poster and convert it to a type mask over the cloudy sky image.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the Text tool (<img src = "images/TextTool.gif" alt = "Text
    tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, and then click in a clear area
    underneath the sky image where you will type the course title. Type, in
    capital letters, ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAM. Use Chaparral Pro, bold, 28 pt.
    Press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; after each word to left
    justify-them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/AsianStudiesProgramLeftJustified.gif" alt = "Asian

    text, then click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/Lower1StepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower One Step icon" width = "26">) in
    the Tool Controls Bar to place the image behind the text. We placed the
    image so the lettering is superimposed over the upper left corner where
    there is relatively strong contrast in colors.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> the image that is to be used as a mask is like a cookie
    cutter that cuts out the cookies from the image underneath. <u>Always</u>
    put the masking image or text above the image that you want to have shaped
    like your &ldquo;cookie-cutter&rdquo; image.</p>

    first two lines of the text. Choose the Chaparral Pro font, italic font
    style.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>Now select the first sentence &ldquo;The master of one
    move&hellip;&rdquo; and increase its font size to 22 points and its leading
    to <b>150 %</b> (33 points).</p>

    <li><p>Select the attribution line with the Text tool (<img src =

    <p><b>Note:</b> Inkscape occasionally doesn&rsquo;t give you the exact
    number of points, but gives you a closest approximation, as you can
    see in the figure below, of 13.99 pt, instead of 14 pt. Don&rsquo;t be
    concerned about it &mdash; it&rsquo;s a mathematical artifact of the
    resizing process inside Inkscape&rsquo;s program machinery.</p>

    <li><p>With the Text tool (<img src = "images/TextToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Text tool icon selected in the toolbox" width = "26">), select the
    remaining paragraphs and change their font to Chapparal Pro, 13 points. The

    click on the <b>No paint</b> icon (<img src = "images/NoPaintIcon.gif"
    alt = "No paint icon" width = "26">). The containment box disappears

    <h2>Saving Your File for Electronic Distribution</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now you&rsquo;ll save a copy of the poster in Portable Document Format
  (PDF) so you can distribute it electronically, or link it to your Web site.
  When you save your artwork in PDF format, Inkscape creates an exact snapshot
  of the page that lets you view it online without the fonts or software used
  to create it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip; In the <b>Select file
    to save to</b> dialog box that appears, click on the down arrow at the
    right end of the <b>Save as type:</b> text bar to bring up the file format
    dropdown listing. Choose <b>Portable Document Format (*.pdf)</b>.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/ChoosePDF.gif" alt = "Choose " class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Choose the Portable Document Format option.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>A PDF copy of the Inkscape artwork file is created with the
    <b>.pdf</b> filename extension automatically appended, ready to be saved in
    a convenient storage location.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/SaveAsPDF.gif" alt = "PDF file ready to be saved in
      storage location" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>PDF file is ready to be saved in a storage
      location.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the <b>Save in:</b> navigation bar to go to the storage location.
    Click on the <u>S</u>ave button. A Portable Document Format appears so
    you can fine-tune the portable document format parameters. In the <b>Text
    output options:</b> section, choose <b>Convert text to paths</b> to make
    the file font-independent, and adjust the <b>Resolution for rasterization
    (dpi):</b> to <b>192</b> to reduce graininess of the imagery. Click on the
    <u>O</u>K button.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ConfigurePDFSpecifications.gif" alt = "Adjusting
        parameters for the PDF file" alt = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Adjusting parameters for the PDF file.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Inkscape&rsquo;s default value for Text output is
      <b>Embed fonts</b>. This value means that any PDF viewer will have to
      have all the fonts that the artwork uses available to view the file
      correctly. If the fonts do not exist for that viewer, they will appear as
      a default font that might not reflect the artwork accurately. It is wise
      to choose the <b>Convert text to paths</b> options so the text is
      font-independent and will render correctly every time.</p>
      <p>Computers and Web browser technology has advanced over the years to
      where high resolution imagery is the standard. Inkscape&rsquo;s default
      raster resolution is 96 dots per inch. Doubling that value significantly
      reduces the graininess seen in low-resolution images and improves their
      appearance. High-quality printing might require even higher values,
      depending upon the technology used. You have the option of increasing
      resolution to any custom value just by changing the value of the raster
      resolution. The value is automatically saved in the file.</p>

  <p>You have now finished this tutorial on typography. We have only touched
  the surface of what you can do with text in graphic design &mdash; it is
  such a broad topic. Explore whatever ideas arise, and play with the features
  Inkscape offers you in putting those ideas on-screen. Explore the World-Wide
  Web as a vast showcase of artwork that you can learn from, mimic, expand upon,
  and redo with your own touch, to expand your own capabilities, skills, and
  imagination.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>To enter text in the artwork, do any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Select the Type tool (<img src = "images/TextTool.gif" alt =
        "Text tool" width = "26">) and start typing.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Copy text from an external file to the Clipboard, and then
        paste into the artwork using <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste or
        &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V (hot key combination for pasting).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Click inside a shape that has text already placed inside through
        the text flow feature with the Type tool (<img src =
        "images/TextTool.gif" alt = "Text tool" width = "26">) and start
        typing.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>To change the font and size of type, you can use the controls in
    the Text and Font palette, or choose commands from the Font and Size
    submenus in the Type Tool Commands Bar.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Convert type to paths when you want to transform (scale, reshape,
    and so on) letters individually in the word or block of type. Paths are
    also useful for filling type with a gradient fill. Paths also eliminate the
    need to send the font along with the file when sharing with others.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create the path you want the text to follow using a shape, or by
    using the Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen
    tool icon" width = "26">) or Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Pen tool icon" width = "26">). Have the text available (already
    typed or pasted in). Select both the text and the path, and choose
    <u>T</u>ext &gt; <u>P</u>ut on Path.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>One way to create a type mask is to select the type that you want to
    be the mask, and select the object, bitmap image, or type that you want to
    show through the mask. (The masking type must be in front of any other
    objects.) Then choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Clip &gt; <u>S</u>et to create the
    type mask.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To create a PDF version of an Inkscape file, you choose <u>F</u>ile
    &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip;; then for type, you select Portable Document
    Format.</p>
    </li>
