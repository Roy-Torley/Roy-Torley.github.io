    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this tutorial, you will continue applying different styles of paint
  brush and drawing pencil to a template file you were working on in the last
  tutorial, Tutorial 14, Part B. You will work with the Calligraphy Pen tool
  and learn how to create a scribble texture. You will add details using the
  <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function to improve the composition of the poster
  artwork.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Below is the finished poster that you will work toward in this
    tutorial.</p>
    <figure>

  </li>
  <li><p>To begin working, File &gt; Open file <b>Brushes.svg</b>, which you
  were working on in the last tutorial. If file <b>Brushes.svg</b> is not
  available, then download file <a href =
  "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C_start.svg"><b>Tutorial14C_start.svg</b></a>
   and store it in a convenient location on your computer. Choose File &gt;
   Open to open it.</p>

    <h2>Moving Objects Between Layers</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can give the poster imagery a touch of stylized depth by moving a
  couple of tufts of grass from in back of the rope tied around the tree to in
  front of the rope, suggesting that the rope is tied right against the tree
  trunk, behind the grass tufts.</p>

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can&rsquo;t access the tufts of grass right now because they
    are located in the <b>Grass</b> layer, which is locked, and the <b>Boat
    and Rope</b> layer is the current active layer.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>Locked layer</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/LayerLockedIcon.gif" alt = "Locked layer icon" width = "26">) of
    the <b>Grass</b> layer to unlock that layer (<img src =

    <h2>Simulating a Paintbrush Stroke</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this section, you will use the cloud image below as the template to
  draw a new version in which the stroke looks as if you had dipped a paintbrush
  into paint and drew the cloud outline with one stroke.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/Template2Painting.gif" alt = "Template and painting
      comparison of cloud motif" class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The cloud motif template is situated just to the right of the
    artboard. The stroke has been given a gradient at the lower left to texture
    the color. When the cloud has been modified, it will look as if a paintbrush
    had been applied and lifted off where the blue color lightens.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Cloud01.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Cloud motif template.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">) so you can see the structure of the cloud
    template image. You can see the gradient handles in the lower left of the
    image.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Cloud02.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Cloud template in Node tool view.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Object &gt; Fill and Stroke&hellip;, Stroke paint tab. Note
    that the <b>Linear gradient</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/LinearGradientIconHighlighted.gif" alt = "Linear gradient icon
    highlighted" width = "26">) is highlighted, indicating that the cloud image
    has a gradient attached to it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Cloud03.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The Linear gradient icon is highlighted.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will remove the gradient from the cloud image by clicking on
    the <b>Flat color</b> icon (<img src = "images/FlatColorIcon.gif" alt =
    "Flat color icon" width = "26">) just left of the <b>Linear gradient</b>
    icon. The cloud motif turns a solid blue color.</p>

        <img src = "images/Cloud04.gif" alt = "Removing the gradient" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Removing the gradient.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now comes the interesting part of this section. Download art file
    <a href = "2174691.svg"><b>2174691.svg</b></a>. This file contains
    an image of an ink spot, say, like the ink spot in Robert Louis
    Stevenson&rsquo;s book <u>Treasure Island</u>. This image will provide the
    texture needed to simulate a paintbrush stroke.</p>
    <p>This art file of an ink splotch can also be downloaded from <a href =
    "https://svgsilh.com/image/2174691.html"><b>https://svgsilh.com/image/2174691.html</b></a>
    at <a href = "https://svgsilh.com/"><b>SVG SILF</b></a>, where there are
    many other examples available for free download (you can enter <b>splat ink
    grunge</b> in the search bar for more ink spots).</p>
    <p>The ink spot is a large image. You will rescale it to a manageable size,
    rotate it, squash it almost totally flat, and then apply it to the cloud
    motif as a pattern using the <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function
    (<b>L</b>ive <b>P</b>attern <b>E</b>ffect).</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> this <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function is different
    from the <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function used to create the rope in
    the previous tutorial (Tutorial 14, Part B). You access it by choosing
    Path &gt; Path Effects&hellip; and then selecting an effect from an effects
    GUI (<u>G</u>raphic <u>U</u>ser <u>I</u>nterface). Once the path has been
    modified, you can still edit it using the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">)
    and the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node tool
    icon" width = "26">).
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Inkspot2174691.gif" alt = "Our starting inkspot"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Our starting inkspot.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The inkspot has a couple of trailing extensions on its right side
    that can contribute to making fine hair-line traces for the end of the
    cloud motif&rsquo;s outline, as if a camel-hair paintbrush was being used.
    We chose to rotate the inkspot by 180 degrees to make it a little easier to
    smoothen the opposite side to make a smooth bullet-shaped head.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Inkspot02.gif" alt = "Rotating the inkspot"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Rotating the inkspot.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>To start the smoothening process, select the <b>Eraser</b> tool in
    the hidden tools area found at the bottom of the toolbox (click on the
    right-pointing arrow (<img src = "images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt =
    "Right-pointing arrow" width = "26">)). Set the <b>Width</b> to <b>20</b>.
    <b>20</b> is a good width with which to start. Use the <b>Eraser</b> as you
    would a regular rubber eraser. Press the left mouse button and move the
    mouse back and forth as if you were using a rubber eraser. It traces a red
    active path that disappears in a second or two once the underlying colored
    pixels have been erased. If you are dissatisfied with what you see or made
    a mistake, undo your work by clicking on the <b>Undo</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/UndoIcon.gif" alt = "Undo icon" width = "26">) in the Tool Controls
    bar or by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z until you get back to where you want
    to be.</p>
    <p>With the <b>Eraser</b>, erase all the small spots of ink that you find
    splattered around the main splotch.</p>
        <img src = "images/Inkspot03.gif" alt = "Erasing extraneous spots with
        the Eraser tool" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Erasing extraneous spots with the Eraser tool.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Examine the right side of the ink splotch to assess how much you
    want to erase to create a smooth side. This side will serve as the head
    of the paintbrush stroke that you will create shortly.</p>
    <p>With smooth, even strokes of the <b>Eraser</b> tool, shave off the
    protuberances on the right side of the ink splotch.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Inkspot05.gif" alt = "Erasing rough edges and
        smoothing the right side of the inkspot" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Erasing rough edges and smoothing the right side of the
        inkspot.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>It is okay to leave one or two protuberances on the top and bottom
    sides. They will be stretched out to simulate an occasional, random brush
    hair streak that can help to texture a camel-hair brush stroke.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Inkspot06.gif" alt = "Resulting smoothened head of

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now, squash the ink splotch. No, you aren&rsquo;t going to step on
    it. With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), use a top or bottom sizing handle to
    make the ink shape thinner so you can see how it can be stretched as a
    pattern along a path and made to look like a brush stroke.</p>

  </header>
  <p>Now that you have created the cloud motif, it is time to put it to use by
  applying it to the border of the poster and to a path you will create above
  the tree.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Create a new layer for the clouds.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>View Layers</b> icon (<img src =

    on the <b>Add new layer</b> plus sign (<img src =
    "images/AddLayerPlusSign.gif" alt = "Add layer icon" width = "26">)
    underneath the layer list to add the new layer, call it <b>Clouds</b>, and

    automatically.</p>

    <li><p>You will now draw a rectangle using the border rectangle as a guide.
    This rectangle will become the path for cloud motifs that will line the
    border.</p>
    <p>Select the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Rectangle tool icon" width = "26">) and draw a rectangle that follows
    the rectangle guide. It might have a color fill and, perhaps, a border with
    the same or a different color &mdash; that is not important.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> the rectangle in the figure below has been made transparent
    to help in visualization.</p>

    Nodes appear on the rectangle corners allowing you to adjust the roundness
    of the corners (the circle at the top right corner), and two squares for
    adjusting rectangle length and width.</p>
    <p>The four nodes inside the rectangle allow you to change the
    number/density of the sine waves and how they are angled.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>The two left-hand circles are reference points (or zero points, if
    you will) for their corresponding Scale/Direction node and Bend node. You
    can move all four around to achieve different effects.</p>
    <p>You will work with Scale/Direction node (upper left diamond). The sine
    waves will remain straight, so you will not need the Bend node (lower right
    diamond).</p>

        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Hatch nodes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>To achieve the look of grass, you need to move the Scale/Direction
    node in toward its corresponding reference circle. Move it in slowly to
    see how its action affects the look of the sine waves. Moving this node in
    toward its reference point causes more sine waves to be created, increasing
    the density of the waves in the lawn rectangle until they become
    indistinguishable from each other, creating the impression of lawn
    grass.</p>
    <p>The Scale/Direction node is very sensitive to placement and you might
    find that Inkscape reacts relatively slowly to node movement. The slowness
    arises from Inkscape performing some intense calculations behind the scenes
    to maintain the &ldquo;sloppy&rdquo; or quasi-random look of the sine waves
    as more waves are created and sized to fit properly within their rectangular
    confine. If response time lengthens, then slow down in moving the
    Scale/Direction node further so Inkscape can catch up with you. Do give
    yourself time to get used to how this feature works.</p>
    <p>Because the Scale/Direction node also acts to give the sine waves an
    angle of inclination, keep the node even with its reference point. Again,
    note how sensitive the results are to node placement.</p>

    below has a magnification of 1200 percent. At this magnification, or higher
    or lower, you can position the Scale/Direction node very close to its

    <p>Zoom in to the nodes &mdash; the magnification is 1200% in the figure

    You achieve this inclination by moving the Scale/Direction node in toward
    its reference point and positioning it below the reference point by about
    50 degrees. Note how sensitive the Scale/Direction node is to positioning.

      <h2>Rearranging Layers</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Now is a good point in time to rearrange layers into an order that makes
    sense.</p>
    <p>In the last section, you have been in the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer. It
    is located topmost in the layer stack that makes up your artwork. In
    reality, a lawn should lie underneath a tree and lake water should lie
    underneath a boat. It only makes sense that the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer
    should be put underneath those other layers. It can lie above the
    <b>Guides</b> layer.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer was created in the last section, is
    currently active &mdash; it is highlighted in the Layers list &mdash; and

    </li>
    <li><p>You will move the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer down in the stack until
    it sits ontop of the bottommost <b>Guides</b> layer.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>Lower the current layer</b> button and wait for a few
    second while Inkscape carries out behind-the-scenes calculations, after
    which the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer reappears one level down in the
    stack.</p>
    <p>Repeat the above step until the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer is located
    immediately above the <b>Guides</b> layer. Be patient with Inkscape while
    it calculates &mdash; that is one of its jobs.</p>

    <h2>Text with Scribbles</h2>
  </header>
  <p>A challenging technique to explore involves making regular text look as if
  it was scribbled. It adds to the composition of a piece of artwork when the
  scribbled look is central to its theme.</p>
  <p>There are two techniques involved in working with scribbled text. They
  both use the <b>Hatches</b> path effect. Letters that are open to the outside
  are treated one way. Letters that contain enclosed spaces need to be treated
  differently to retain those open areas.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Type LAKESIDE DESIGNS using a sans-serif font. We used Myriad Pro,
    bold, 72 points, 72 point leading (space between lines), and centered
    alignment.</p>

        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Starting text.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The text contains letters that are entirely open to the outside and
      letters that contain enclosed spaces. Because we need to treat the two
      types of letters differently, we need to separate them as groups. There
      are only three closed letters to separate from the pack: one A and two
      Ds.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Convert the text, which is a single object, into a single path by
    choosing Path &gt; Object to Path.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>You can move an object from one layer to another by first selecting it.
    Then, if it is on a layer lower in the layer stack than the destination
    layer, then press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgUp&gt; until the destination layer is
    highlighted in the <b>Layers</b> dialog box. If the object to be moved is in
    a layer higher than the destination layer, press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgDn&gt;
    until the destination layer is highlighted in the <b>Layers</b> dialog
    box.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You use the <b>Hatches (rough)</b> path effect, found as an option
    in the Path &gt; Path Effects&hellip; <b>Live Path Effects Selector</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If you apply the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> path effect on an object
    that is to be used as a pattern and a path, and obtain a strange result,
    you can select the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">) to view the underlying structure of the
    path effect, click-drag the <b>Width</b> node toward its associated
    path node, and observe the changing figure until it conforms to what you
    envision it to be.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>After you have drawn your scribbles, you can increase the number of
    up-and-down strokes by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b> node <u>toward</u>
    its corresponding reference point (open circle), or decrease the number of
    strokes by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b> node <u>away</u> from its
    reference point.</p>
    <p>You change the angle of orientation by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b>
    node <u>around</u> its reference point until the inclination of the strokes
    is just how you want it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Examples of Latin-based letters include:<p>
    <p>Capital letters: A, B, D, O, P, Q, R</p>
    <p>Lower-case letters: a, b, d, e, g, o, p, q</p>
    <p>These letters require masks to eliminate the internal white space that
    is left as an artifact of the <b>Hatches</b> path effect process.</p>
