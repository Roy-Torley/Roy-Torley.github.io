    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this tutorial, you will apply different styles of paint brush and
  drawing pencil to a template file that contains the paths that you will
  trace over and apply brush effects to.</p>
  <p>This tutorial is the first of three parts that explore the use of painting
  and drawing with the aim of stylizing what you draw. Take your time exploring
  the different techniques and tools, become familiar with their capabilites and
  limitations, and include them in your toolbox of means to enhancing your
  skills as a graphic artist.</p>

    <h2>Using Art Brush Tools</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Art brushes stretch artwork evenly along a path. They include strokes
  resembling various graphic media, such as the Chalk and Sponge, and Marker
  brushes. Brush tools don&rsqou;t exist as a distinct central palette of tools
  in Inkscape. Instead, they are distributed throughout Inkscape&rsqou;s
  organization of features. In this section, you&rsquo;ll create and apply a
  custom charcoal brush to draw the trunk and limbs of a tree in a way that
  imitates using a charcoal pencil.</p>
  <p>The start file has been created with guides that you can use to create
  and align your artwork for this tutorial. They are locked and cannot be
  selected, moved, modified, or printed (unless they are unlocked). The guides
  in the illustration above are very light (that is how they are in the
  original file). They will be darkened a bit in the rest of this tutorial so
  you can see them more easily.</p>
  <h4>Applying a Tapered Stroke Effect to a Path</h4>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll start by drawing the trunk of the tree in a two-step process.
  The first step involves tracing over the two trunk guides using the Pencil
  tool (<img src = "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pencil tool icon" width =
  "26">).</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Select the Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Pencil tool icon" width = "26">). In the <b>Pencil Tool Control Bar</b>,
    set <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to <b>Triangle
    in</b>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectTriangleIn.gif" alt = "Selecting Triangle in"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Setting <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to
        <b>Triangle in</b>.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The <b>Smoothing</b> function acts to reduce the small-scale bumps and
      irregularities that commonly appear in a line or curve that you draw
      using the Pencil tool. The <b>Smoothing</b> function allows you to make
      a line or curve smooth by adjusting the smoothing factor from 1 to 100.
      A smoothing factor of 1 keeps all the small bumps and jitters that the
      hand produces. As you increase the smoothing factor, small-scale
      deviations are reduced in size until you achieve an essentially straight
      line, no matter how jiggly the line is.</p>
      <p>A few examples below demonstrate how the smoothing function works:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src = "images/SmoothingExamples.gif" alt = "Examples of
          smoothing" class = "img-fluid">
          <figcaption>Examples of smoothing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Drag the Pencil tool cursor up for the left side of the trunk and
    down for the right side. Your line might look different in color and width
    than the line in the figure below. You&rsquo;ll take care of that
    shortly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/TreeTrunk1.gif" alt = "Drawing the left side of the
        tree trunk" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Drawing the left trunk line.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Note how the line tapers from a somewhat wide start to a thin end.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Draw the right line for the tree trunk.<p>
    <p>Choose <b>Triangle out</b> for <b>Shape</b> and draw up from the rope
    knot at the bottom right of the trunk to the upstairs intersection with a
    branch.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/TreeTrunk2.gif" alt = "Drawing the right side of them
        tree trunk" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Drawing the right trunk line.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will widen the starting point of the left line.</p>
    <p>Magnify the starting point of the line and click the Node tool (<img src
    = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node tool icon" width = "26">) in the
    toolbox. Three nodes appear on the line, two of which are at the starting
    point. One of the latter two nodes terminates the main trace or spine of the
    line. The other is a width handle that allows you to change how wide the
    line is at the starting point.</p>

        <img src = "images/TreeTrunk3.gif" alt = "Drawing the right side of them
        tree trunk" class = "img-fluid">

        icon points to the width handle.</figcaption>

    starting point.</p>

    <li><p>Repeat the last two steps for the right line. The width handle is
    located at the wide top of the line.</p>

  <h4>Creating a Custom Filter with the Filter Editor</h4>
  <aside>
    <p><b>What Is a Filter?</b></p>
    <p>A <b>filter</b> or <b>filter effect</b> is one or more mathematical
    operations that a graphics program, such as Inkscape, applies to something
    that you have drawn &mdash; a star, a tree, a dragonfly wing, etc. &mdash; and
    produces a modified result &mdash; a star with a halo, a tree drawn with a
    charcoal pencil, a transparent wing that shows what lies underneath, etc.
    All the math is done behind the scenes. What&rsquo;s important is the visual
    result on your screen, the print-out on good stationery, or added to a
    video scene.</p>
    <p>The filtering process starts out with a <i>source graphic</i>, your
    original drawing. The filter program first analyzes the color fills,
    strokes, paths, and other attributes that contribute to the drawing and then
    transforms at least one of the attributes according to how the filter is put
    together. Below are a few examples of source graphics that have a filter
    applied to them.</p>
      <figure>

  <p>Inkscape does not have a filter that mimics drawing with a charcoal
  pencil. So, you will create a charcoal filter using Inkscape&rsquo;s
  Filter Editor.</p>

      <p><b>What Is a Filter Primitive?</b></p>
      <p>When a filter is created that does several things to its associated
      source graphic, it is commonly convenient to take very simple filter
      components and link them together so that the graphic output from one
      serves as the input for the next. These components are called <b>filter
      primitives</b>. They commonly do just one simple thing, such as creating
      a blur, moving (displacing) pixels to a new location, tile multiple copies
      of the original source image (source graphic), and introducing different
      types of visual noise.</p>
      <p>Inkscape allows you to construct new filters using its Filter editor.
      You can modify original images you make that are otherwise difficult or
      inconvenient to construct using tools in the toolbox. Once the new filter
      has been constructed, all you need to do is select the source graphic,
      make a couple of selections, and the result appears immediately.</p>
    </aside>

  <h4>Using the Spray Tool As a Brush</h4>
  <p>When you spray art objects along a guide or path, you are using the Spray
  tool as if it were a paint brush. Objects can be sprayed directly onto a path
  or splashed on so that the result is a scattering of objects, yet still
  centered along the path, like leaves swept into rows or sand grains aligned
  in ripples.</p>
  <p>In this section, you will paint leaves along the tree branches in a very
  loose manner using the Spray tool.</p>

    <h2>Collecting Tapered Pencil Strokes to Simulate a Single Paintbrush

  <p>One way to imitate brush strokes involves drawing individual lines made

  tip of any width. You can also use this technique to create tufts of grass,

  <h2>Drawing with the Pencil Tool&rsquo;s Ellipse Shape and the Bucket Fill
  Tool</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You will learn how to work with the Pen tool&rsquo;s ellipse shape option
  to draw the outline of the boat. Then, you will learn how to use the Bucket
  Fill tool in color fill in the space within an unclosed curve.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>First, create a new layer ontop of the <b>Grass</b> layer you just
    created earlier. Label it <b>Boat and Rope</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Pencil tool icon" width = "26">). In the <b>Pencil Tool Control Bar</b>,
    set <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to <b>Ellipse</b>.</p>
    <p>Using the guides, click-drag the Pencil tool along the nearer edge of
    the top of the boat, and keeping the left mouse key depressed, continue
    drawing along the bottom of the boat back to the starting point. Note that
    there is a very thin line showing where you had drawn.</p>
    <p>While you draw, you will note irregularities in the curvature of the
    line trace because of your hand jiggling a little bit or the cat running
    interference against your arm and hand. The <b>Smoothing</b> function will
    eliminate many of the irregularities because you set its level to <b>20</b>.
    You&rsquo;ll smooth the remaining irregularities out shortly.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re not satisfied with the result, you can always undo the
    last with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or by choosing Edit &gt; Undo and start over.</p>

    Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =

    the Thickness handle visible. Click-drag the Thickness handle in toward the
    starting node to which it is attached to make the curve thinner. The
    Thickness handle can be very sensitive to movement, so it might be helpful
    to magnify the artwork so you can control the handle&rsquo;s movement more
    easily.</p>

    <p>Increase the magnification of the fill area, making sure that none of it

    <p>The color fill area is placed above its bounding curve in the image

    <h2>Final Word Before Chapter 14, Part B</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Using brush techniques to texture how strokes, line segments, and curves
  look is a broad subject that is way beyond the scope of this tutorial. The
  techniques that you have learned up to this point can already serve you very
  well in creating artwork that invites the visitor to look more closely, and
  enjoy both the small details and how they weave themselves into the larger
  picture. The next tutorial, Tutorial 14B, explores how to fill a space with
  Inkscape pen and pencil scribble techniques, and how to apply them to texture
  the appearance of text, to where it is no longer a string of letters, but
  text stylized to capture and hold your viewer&rsquo;s attention through your
  inventiveness.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Inkscape has available the Pencil tool (<img src =
    "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pencil tool icon" width = "26">),
    the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool icon"
    width = "26">), the Spray tool, the Calligraphy tool (<img src =
    "images/CalligraphyToolIcon.gif" alt = "Calligraphy tool icon" width =
    "26">), and the Paint Bucket tool (<img src =
    "images/PaintBucketToolIcon.gif" alt = "Paint Bucket tool icon" width =
    "26">).</p>
    <p>The Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pencil
    tool icon" width = "26">) allows you to draw or trace along a guide as if
    you were using an actual pencil. You can stylize what you draw using the
    Triangle in, Triangle out, and Ellipse options, among others.</p>
    <p>The Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool icon"
    width = "26">) allows you to draw simple or stylized curves in addition to
    lines and edit them as you draw using nodes and node handles.</p>
    <p>The Paint Bucket tool (<img src = "images/PaintBucketToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Paint Bucket tool icon" width = "26">) lets you fill in spaces according
    to criteria that you specify in the Paint Bucket Tool Control Bar.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>A filter is an operation or process that alters an image that already
    has been drawn or painted, that is, an <u>original</u> or <u>source</u>
    graphic image. The filter adds something extra to the image, such as giving
    it a blur, a shadow, a glow, or a change in shape.</p>
    <p>A filter primitive is a filter that performs commonly just one operation.
    It can be considered a simple piece that can be added or linked together
    with other simple "filter pieces" or components using a filter editor to
    create a graphic operation that can perform complex actions on a source
    graphic.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The Spray tool can be thought of as a type of brush that brushes
    objects (or copies of an object) onto the workspace, much like dipping a
    paint brush into some glue, and then into a collection of objects, such as
    leaves, confetti, or raindrop shapes, and then brushing them onto a canvas.
    The number of objects sprayed on, the spray area around the Spray tool
    cursor, and other attributes are adjustable in the <b>Spray Tool Controls
    Bar</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>After you have drawn your shape with the Pencil or Pen tool, select
    the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node tool icon"
    width = "26">). The curve (or curve spine), nodes, node handles, and the
    Thickness handle appear, allowing adjustment of curve position and
    thickness.</p>
    <p>When color filling the curve, use the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to
    view the color fill. When making fine adjustments to the curve, you might
    find yourself switching between the views furnished by the Select tool and
    Node tool &mdash; the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) allowing you to see coloration,
    and the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node tool
    icon" width = "26">) allowing you to see structural controls for the
    curve.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
