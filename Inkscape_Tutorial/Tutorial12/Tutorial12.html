    <h2>Creating an Object to Use with the Spray Tool</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You create an object to be sprayed onto your artwork like any other object.
  It acts, however, as the source for duplicates that you spray on as if you
  were using an air brush that sprays on droplets of paint, but not just colors.
  For example, if you create an object in the shape of a blade of grass, you
  can then add instances of that grass multiple times to your artwork by
  spraying it on using the Spray tool.</p>
  <p>When you click on the Spray tool icon (<img src =
  "images/SprayToolIcon.gif" alt = "Spray tool icon" width = "26">) in the
  toolbox, the <b>Spray Tool Controls Bar</b> appears above or to the right of
  the work window (depending on how you configured toolbar placement),
  presenting options to modify how the tool operates.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/SprayToolControlsBar.gif" alt = "Spray tool controls
      bar" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Spray Tool Controls Bar.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <figcaption>Left portion of Spray Tool Controls Bar.</figcaption>
      <img src = "images/SprayToolBarLeftSideWithLabels.png"
      alt = "Left portion of Spray tool controls bar" class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <figcaption>Right portion of Spray Tool Controls Bar.</figcaption>
      <img src = "images/SprayToolBarRightSideWithLabels.png"
      alt = "Right portion of Spray tool controls bar" class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
  <p>If you choose the <b>Spray <u>copies</u></b> option, you can spray on just
  copies of the original object. Each copy is a stand-alone object that you can
  edit or replace independently of all the other copies. If you later want to
  modify selected instances, you can, using the Select tool (<img src =
  "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">)
  and one or another technique of group-selection.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
      <img src = "images/CopyExample1.gif" alt = "Example of spraying objects
      in copy mode" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Example of spraying objects in Copy mode.<br>
      Source object on the left, sprayed duplicates on the right.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>In Copy mode, individual duplicated objects can be
      modified.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>If you chose the <b>Spray <u>clones</u></b> option, then all clone
  instances are linked to the original source object. This means that you can
  alter <u>all</u> instances by selecting the original instance, and then
  editing or replacing it &ndash; all instances of that object will be updated.
  You can turn that grass from brown to green instantly! This tool can be a
  great time-saver as you create your artwork.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/CloneExample.gif" alt = "Example of spraying objects
    in clone mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>When Clone mode is used, duplicated objects are linked to their
    source object.<br>When a source object is modified, all corresponding
    sprayed objects are also modified.<br>Source object on the left, sprayed
    duplicates on the right.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If you choose to work with the <b><u>single path</u></b> option, then all
  duplicated objects become part of a single path. If any of the sprayed objects
  overlap, the overlapping strokes are removed, creating the appearance that
  the objects have been merged (into a path union).</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/SinglePathExample.gif" alt = "Example of spraying objects
    in single path mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>When Single path mode is used, duplicated objects are converted
    into paths and<br>merged together into a path union (single path).<br>
    Source object on the left, sprayed duplicates on the right.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Inkscape objects that can be used are: paths, compound paths, text,
  raster images, mesh objects, and groups of objects. You can use active
  objects, such as blends, effects, or other object instances that make up a
  larger object.</p>

  <p>You can find more information about the Spray Tool at <u>H</u>elp &gt;
  Inkscape Manual &gt; 12. Spray Tool.</p>

    <h2>Applying a Spray Object Instance</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now you&rsquo;ll use the Spray tool to apply the face to your
  illustration.</p>
  <ol start = "2">
    <li><p>With the face object still selected, click on the Spray tool (<img
    src = "images/SprayToolIcon.gif" alt = "Spray tool icon" width = "26">) in
    the toolbox.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the <b>Copy</b> mode for spraying. Some good settings are:
    <b>Width: 3</b>, <b>Amount: 3</b>, and <b>Scale: 0</b>. Click on the
    <b>Apply over no transparent areas</b> icon
    (<img src = "images/ApplyOverNoTransparentAreasIcon.gif" alt = "Apply over
    no transparent areas icon" width = "26">) &mdash; any seemingly blank areas
    have a white fill, thus are not transparent.</b>
    </p>
    <li><p>Click and drag using the Spray tool, much like an airbrush, or can
    of paint, to create a crowd with your face object. Experiment dragging at
    different speeds. You&rsquo;ll find that the number of copies that appear
    changes with how fast you drag the mouse.</p>

    <p>In the next steps, you will add an additional source object, then edit
    and update it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>While on the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif"
      alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), click anywhere off the

      </li>
      <li><p>Using the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen
      tool icon" width = "26">) in the toolbox, create several blades of grass.
      Draw at least 8 line segments to make a tuft of grass. Don&rsquo;t be
      worried if they&rsquo;re a different color than the color as shown
      below. You&rsquo;ll change the color shortly.</p>

          <figcaption>Making a tuft of grass.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li></p>These line segments are individual objects. In preparation for
      spraying whole tufts of grass, you&rsquo;ll need to group the line
      segments.</p>
      <p>Group-select the collection of line segments and then press
      &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group them into one grass-tuft object.</p>

      <p><b>Important Note</b></p>
      <p>You are using the <b>Spray copies</b> mode because you will be
      transfering the front face image to a box figure created by the
      <b>Extrude</b> tool. Copied duplicates (forgive the redundancy in the
      English language) will transfer with no problem. If you create duplicates
      of the grass tuft using the <b>Spray clones</b> mode, only the original
      image will transfer, the copies won&rsquo;t. The copies will remain in
      place. When you plan to use the <b>Extrude</b>, <b>Envelope</b>, and
      Spray tools in combination, remember this constraint: use the <b>Spray
      copies</b> mode to duplicate objects.</p>

      <h2>Making a Three-dimensional Box Using the Extrude Tool</h2>
    </header>
    <p>You can make boxes, cylinders, and other objects that allow you to make
    a prism out of a top and bottom geometric shape. I recommend that you use
    it to create objects that have a sense of nearness to you, the observer. If
    you want to create an object that gives the illusion of great size and
    distance from near point to far point, then you might achieve more
    desirable results using the Perspective Tool.</p>
    <p>You will create a box where the observer&rsquo;s point of view is from
    the top and to the front left side.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Draw a rectangle with the Rectangle tool (<img src =
      "images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool icon" width = "26">).
      Make it a little narrower in width than the box front image.</p>

          for the box" class = "img-fluid">
          <figcaption>Drawing the starting rectangle for the box.</figcaption>

      </li>
      <li><p>You will now skew the rectangle to simulate a view point from the
      top left corner. If the rectangle is deselected, reselect it, and choose

      choose the degree sign (<img src = "images/DegreeSign.gif" alt = "Degree
      sign" height = "26">), and type <b>15</b> in the <b><u>V</u>ertical</b>
      text box. Click on the <u>A</u>pply button. The rectangle looks like it
      is rotated through a small angle.</p>

      </li>
      <li><p>The duplicate quadrilateral (it does have four sides) lies topmost
      in the image stack, above the original quadrilateral. Inkscape right now
      &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; that it is the front side of the box. You need to
      send it to underneath the original so Inkscape will interpret it as the
      backside of the box.</p>
      <p>Click on the <b>Lower selection to bottom</b> icon (<img src =
      "images/LowerSelectionToBottom.gif" alt = "Lower selection to bottom
      icon" width = "26">) in the Tools Control Bar. The duplicate figure is

      <li><p>Both quadrilaterals are objects and Inkscape &ldquo;sees&rdquo;
      them as such. You need to transform them into paths and merge the paths
      into one item (one merged path) in order for the <b>Extrude</b> tool to
      work.</p>
      <p>&lt;Shift&gt;-click the duplicate quadrilateral to group-select it
      with the original. Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path to
      convert both quadrilaterals from objects into paths.</p>

      objects</b> icon (<img src = "images/GroupSelectedObjects.gif" alt =
      "Group selected objects icon" width = "26">) in the Tool Controls Bar to
      merge them into a single path item. You will see no change in the paths
      or their bounding boxes, but Inkscape now recognizes them as a collection
      of connected nodes and paths, something that the <b>Extrude</b> tool
      can work with.</p>
        <figure>

    <p>In this section, you will prepare and emplace the text CEREAL onto the

    <b>Envelope</b> function during emplacement and learn how to work around
    it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Move the text CEREAL to the left side of the box figure. Having

      CEREAL text that&rsquo;s about the same size as the left side of the box.
      The size does not have to be exact because the <b>Envelope</b> function
      will resize the rectangle to fit the geometry of the box left side.</p>
      <p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>A</u>lign and Distribute&hellip; and

      the same size as the top face of the box. Using the <b>Fill and Stroke</b>
      panel, give the rectangle a slightly darker blue than the side face (we
      used the blue color defined in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel ). Give
      it a stroke of <b>none</b> as was done earlier with the side face.</p>

      center the text SUPERSTAR both horizontally and vertically as you did
      earlier with the side text CEREAL. Note that the text SUPERSTAR is a

      </li>
      <li><p>With both the rectangle and text still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath
      &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path. Both rectangle and text are now just a
      collection of line segments and curves. Note that the baseline marker
      for the text has disappeared. You see the text, but Inkscape
      &ldquo;sees&rdquo; just line segments and curves and not as objects
      anymore &mdash; the <b>Envelope</b> function can work with this
      arrangement.</p>

      <h2>Final Edits</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The box artwork is almost complete. You will now add a finishing touch
    by applying a border to the front face image of the box. Most of the work
    involves ungrouping levels of groups until you can finally access the
    bottommost image, which is the white rectangle that underlies the entire
    image. Only then will you be able to apply a border that encompasses only
    the very edge of the front face.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Click on the front face with the Select tool (<img src =
      "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">).
      Then press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to ungroup the top level of
      objects that make up the face image. Background faces, the baseball
      player, the text SUPERSTAR, and tufts of grasses have bounding boxes to
      indicate that they are now separate objects.</p>

      upper portion of the background to select it. Note that the background is
      comprised of four objects: three colored panels that make up the lower
      half of the background and the white upper portion. Right now, they are
      grouped.</p>
      <p>Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to ungroup these four objects.

    <p>You have finished Tutorial 12. It is your introduction to
    Inkscape&rsquo;s methodology for creating artwork that has a 3-D look to it.
    Ways to enhance depth, the perspective of distance, and the change in
    illumination with depth include using the Perspective function, gradient
    tools, selective blurring of background objects, and color blending to
    give texture to your third dimension.</p>
    <p>Continue to explore what Inkscape has to offer you. Let your imagination
    open up new scenes for you and your desire to explore propel you forward
    and expand your personal frontier of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>

      <h2>Review Questions</h2>
    </header>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the difference between the <b>Spray copies of the initial
      selection</b> mode and the <b>Spray clones of the initial selection</b>
      mode when using the Spray tool?
      </li>
      <li>Can you spray grouped objects? How?
      </li>
      <li>Does the <b>Extrude</b> tool work with objects, paths, or both?
      </li>
      <li>What can you do when an image is not emplaced properly on an extruded
      object?</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>

      <h2>Review Answers</h2>
    </header>
    <ol>
      <li><p><b>Spray copies of the initial selection</b> mode allows you to
      make duplicates of the original source object or objects that are
      individual, stand-alone copies. They can be treated as individual objects.
      <b>Spray clones of the initial selection</b> mode allows you to make
      duplicates of the source objects that are connected or linked to the
      source objects. So, if you modify one source object, all the linked clones
      are modified as well.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Yes, you can spray objects that have been grouped. First, select
      the objects that you want to group, then press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group
      them or click on the <b>Group selected objects</b> icon (<img src =
      "images/GroupSelectedObjects.gif" alt = "Group selected objects icon"
      width = "26">) in the Tool Controls Bar.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The <b>Extrude</b> tool works only with paths. Convert an object
      to which you plan to add a third dimension into a path by selecting it,
      then choosing then <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path option. Then
      use the <b>Extrude</b> tool.</p>
      </li>
      <li>There are four options available to you to resolve the emplacement
      problem. Keep in mind that emplacement problems are problems of
      orientation which can be resolved one step at a time. You might need to
      use each option one after another if the situation requires it. Each time
      that you use a step, you can see how the orientation improves and comes
      closer to resolution.
        <ol type = "a">
          <li>If the transferred image is rotated by 90&deg;, undo the transfer
          by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or clicking on the <b>Undo last action</b>
          icon (<img src = "images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif" alt = "Undo last
          action icon" width = "26">) in the Tool Controls Bar. Choose
          <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>R</u>everse. Then, reuse the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
          </li>
          <li>If the transferred imaged is rotated by 180&deg; either
          horizontally or vertically, undo the transfer (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or
          <b>Undo last action</b> (<img src = "images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif"
          alt = "Undo last action icon" width = "26">)), rotate the original
          image 180&deg; horizontally or vertically as the situation requires,
          and then reemplace the image with the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
          </li>
          <li>If the transferred image is a mirror image of the original where
          it has been flipped horizontally or vertically, undo the transfer
          (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or <b>Undo last action</b> (<img src =
          "images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif" alt = "Undo last action icon" width =
          "26">)). Select the original image and then click on the <b>Flip
          selected objects horizontally</b> icon (<img src =
          "images/FlipHorizontallyIcon.gif" alt = "Flip selected objects
          horizontally icon" width = "26">) or <b>Flip selected objects
          vertically</b> icon (<img src = "images/FlipVerticallyIcon.gif" alt =
          "Flip selected objects vertically icon" width = "26">) as the
          situation requires. Then, reemplace the image with the <b>Envelope</b>
          tool.
          </li>
          <li>The emplaced image might have undergone both rotation and
          mirror-imaging. Undo the emplacement and then test one or another of
          the options above until you see improvement in the image&rsquo;s
          orientation. Once you see what you want, then you will have conquered
          the beast. Congratulations!
