<section>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following:</p>
  <ul type = "disc">
    <li>Bend text.
    </li>
    <li>Style text outlines.
    </li>
    <li>Create a 3-D cylinder out a rectangle and ellipses.
    </li>
    <li>Add gradient coloring to create illumination on a curved surface.
    </li>
    <li>Use a Pattern Along Path technique to create and place a decorative band
    around the middle of a cylinder.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tutorial is the first of two parts in which you will create a series
  of 3-D objects for a poster. Each object is made using separate sets of
  drawing techniques to create the illusion of depth.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll create a cylindrical object using the
  ellipse, path union, and gradient tools.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15A/Tutorial15A_end.svg"><b>Tutorial15A_end.svg</b></a> and
    store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>File &gt; Open file <b>Tutorial15A_end.svg</b>. This file displays a
    completed illustration of a soap can, soap balls, and a vase.</p>
    <p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to reduce the view of
    the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen
    as you work. (Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to select and move the artwork
    where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the
    image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>

  </header>
  <p>To begin working, you&rsquo;ll open an existing art file to which you will
  add objects that require a 3-D look.</p>
  <ol start = "4">

    <li><p>File &gt; Save As&hellip; and name the copy of the file
    <b>Lemon.svg</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will stylize the logo. With the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">),
    select the logo text.</p>
    <p>From here on, we will call logo text <b>logotype</b>. In graphic design,
    a logotype is a single piece of text that prints a logo or emblem, or is a
    logo if the figure is centered around a company name or initials.</p>

    <p>Give the lettering a yellow stroke by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the

    <li><p>In the <b>Drop Shadow</b> dialog box, click on the <b>Blur color</b>
    tab to bring up the <b>Blur color</b> palette. Type <b>8bbe1bff</b> into the

    to <b>0.7</b>. The <b>Shadow type</b> should show a default setting of
    <b>Outer</b>. Change the value to <b>Outer</b> if the setting is something
    else.</p>

  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> Inkscape has an idiosyncracy that involves the order
  in which a drop shadow and path bend are applied. In the artwork above, the
  drop shadow filter was applied before applying the path bend effect. The
  result below shows an even casting of the drop shadow.</p>
  <p>If, however, the path bend effect is applied <u>before</u> the drop shadow,
  a portion of the drop shadow is clipped off, producing a visually unpleasant
  result.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/ShadowClipping.gif" alt = "Applying the drop
      shadow filter <u>before</u> the bend path effect and <u>after</u>
      the bend path effect" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Applying the drop shadow filter <u>before</u> the bend path
      effect and <u>after</u> the bend path effect. Note the clipped shadows
      in the second example.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If you want or need to combine drop shadow and bend path effects,
    consider using the <b>Bend</b> path effect last. The <b>Bend</b> path effect
    works on whatever paths you select, including their attributes, such a drop
    shadow. A drop shadow filter extends out from what is easily visible, and
    yet is still part of the shadow region. The <b>Bend</b> tool
    &ldquo;sees&rdquo; that invisible region, considers it as part of the
    shadow, and thus includes it as part of the whole construct that is to be
    warped.</p>
    <p>If, however, the object is bent <u>before</u> applying the drop shadow
    filter, the <b>Bend</b> tool &ldquo;sees&rdquo; only the object to be
    warped, but there is no shadow to include as part of the object. The object
    is warped, and then, when the drop shadow filter is applied, the boundary
    created by the <b>Bend</b> tool inadvertently clips the shadow up to the
    limit set by the bounding box of the original object.</p>
    <p>Should something look not right, consider changing the order with which
    filters and effects are applied as you create your artwork.</p>

  </header>
  <p>The body of the canister looks three-dimensional courtesy of the gradient
  coloration attached to it. It also looks monolithic and uninspiring. A
  well-drawn decorative band placed around its middle gives it appeal and adds
  to the 3-D effect the artwork should have.</p>

    <p>The artwork in this file consists of a stylized leaf made of a leaf
    body and a central vein, both of which are ungrouped objects. The artwork
    appears large because the artboard was resized to fit the leaf and Inkscape
    automatically resizes the artboard to fit the work window.</p>

    <aside><p>The <b>Pattern Along Path</b> path effect works <u>only</u> with one
    ungrouped object that is the pattern and <u>only</u> one path that guides
    the pattern succession. In order to construct a pattern that is made of
    more than one object, such as the leaf motif in this exercise, each object
    needs to be applied to a duplicate of the original path and then moved
    ontop or below the base pattern.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> It is important that all components that make up a composite
    pattern along a path like the leaf body and vein pattern have exactly the
    same length. If lengths are different, one component will not line up with
    another as individually different lengths add up to create an increasing
    mismatch and misalignment as the pattern is traversed from one end to the
    other. It is wise to make sure that 1) individual motifs have the same
    length and 2) that they are applied to paths having the exact same size
    (length) and curvature so the resulting patterns will fit together
    seamlessly.</p>

    <li><p>The leaf pattern looks good enough as a tip-to-toe sequence. It might
    look a little better with some spacing between leaves. Spacing will be
    applied to both the leaf body pattern and the leaf vein pattern separately
    &mdash; they are separate objects.<p>
    <p>Click on an individual leaf body to select it. The whole sequence of
    leaves becomes selected.</p>
    </p>In the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> dialog box, change the <b>Spacing</b>
    from its default of <b>0.00</b> to <b>1.00</b>. The leaf bodies separate
    by a small amount of space in between. The leaf veins remain in their
    original positions &mdash; the leaf vein sequence is an object separate
    from the leaf body object and so is not affected by the change in
    spacing.</p>

    <p>As you did in the previous step, change the <b>Spacing</b> from its
    default of <b>0.00</b> to <b>1.00</b>. Now the leaf veins move to coincide

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Both the top and bottom surfaces of a cylinder need to be shortened
    (transformed) by the same angle to produce a consistent shape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Guidelines are good tools for constraining top and bottom circles or
    ellipses to have matching diameters or axes that also match the width of a
    cylinder body rectangle.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Gradients give the impression of light reflecting off a surface in
    ways that suggest that the surface has depth, is curved, or is at angle to
    the eye of the viewer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Component parts of all motifs must have exactly the same length and
    each path for each motif must have exactly the same length and the same
    curvature.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can clip the projecting part of the pattern by 1) drawing a
    rectangle or other shape that you can use as a graphical cookie cutter, 2)
    placing it over the part of the pattern to clip off, 3) making sure that
    the cookie cutter object lies above the object to clip in the image stack,
    4) selecting both the cookie cutter object and the object to be clipped,
    and 5) choosing Object &gt; Clip &gt; Set Inverse (LPE).</p>
