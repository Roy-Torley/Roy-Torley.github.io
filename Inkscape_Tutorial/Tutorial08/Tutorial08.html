  <ul>
    <li>Use the Transparency feature.</li>
    <li>Change the opacity of objects.</li>
    <li>Use color blending modes.</li>
    <li>Use group options for transparency.</li>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
</header>
<p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll add transparency to artwork in several ways.
You can vary the degree of transparency of an object&rsquo;s fill or stroke (or
both), a group of objects, or a layer from 100% opacity (completely solid) to
0% opacity (completely transparent). When you decrease an object&rsquo;s
opacity, the underlying artwork becomes visible through that object as if you
were working with stained glass.</p>
<p>Using transparency features, you can also create special effects, such as
knocking out underlying colors or creating graduated transparencies or blends.
Transparency can be applied to multiple objects, groups, and even to entire
layers. In this lesson you will focus on the transparency and color blending
features and their capabilities. Learn how to apply transparency to layers in
Lesson 7, "Working with Layers."</p>

    <h2>Basic color blending and blending modes</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Color blending works with layers to produce its visual effects. When an
  object needs to have its own special see-through effect, it is best to have
  that object in its own layer. Several objects that use the same blending mode
  can be in the same layer for the sake of efficiency.</p>
  <p>You will create a layer and move the leftmost wave to that layer to see how
  blending modes work.</p>
  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> If you did not practice Tutorial 6, Working with
  Layers, I strongly recommend that you take time to become acquainted with
  layer techniques now. The material is this tutorial will be easier to work
  with.</p>
  </aside>
  <h3>Creating a layer to house the leftmost wave</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the leftmost wave with the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the Layers icon (<img src = "images/LayersIcon.gif"
    alt = "Layers icon" width = "26">) in the Command menu bar.<p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/FirstWaveLayersPalette.png" alt = "Leftmost wave is
        selected and the Layers palette is active." width = "700" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Leftmost wave is selected and the Layers palette is
        active.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the Add layer plus sign (<img src = "images/AddLayerPlusSign.gif"
    alt = "Add layer plus sign icon" width = "26">) to create a new layer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When the Add Layer dialog box appears, type <b>First wave</b> in the
    <b>Layer name</b> text box, keep the <b>Position</b> as
    <b>Above current</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the <u>A</u>dd button.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/FirstWaveLayerCreated.png" alt = "Layer for the
        leftmost wave is created." width = "700" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The layer for the leftmost wave is created.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the leftmost wave. Note that the Layer 1 bar is highlighted
    in the Layers palette.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/ClickOnLeftmostWave.png" alt = "Click on the leftmost
      wave." width = "700" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Clicking the leftmost wave still in Layer 1.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the leftmost wave still selected, press the
    &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgUp&gt; key combination to move the wave to the <b>First
    wave</b> layer. Note that the top layer bar (First wave) is now
    highlighted. Also, note that the Layer palette now shows a <b>Blend mode</b>
    option, currently showing <b>Normal</b>.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/LeftmostWaveMoved.png" alt = "Leftmost wave is moved
      to the top layer." width = "700" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Leftmost wave has been moved to the top layer.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <h3>Exploring color blend modes</h3>
    <h4>Multiply</h4>
    <li><p>Click on the arrow at the right end of the Blend mode options bar
    and select <b>Multiply</b> from the dropdown option list.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/BlendModesDropdownList.gif" alt = "Blend BlendModes
      Dropdown List" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Blend modes dropdown list.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/FirstWaveMultiplied.png" alt = "Multiply color
      blending applied to leftmost wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Multiply</b> color blend mode to the
      leftmost wave.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p><b>Multiply</b> multiplies the underlying color with the overlapping
  object&rsquo;s color. The result is always a darker color. Multiplying any
  color with black produces black. Multiplying any color with white leaves the
  color unchanged. The effect is similar to drawing with multiple magic markers.
  This blending mode is used often for drop shadows.</p>
  </li>
  <h4>Difference</h4>
  <li><p>With the leftmost wave still selected (if it isn&rsquo;t, then
  reselect it) select <b>Difference</b> from the dropdown option list.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/SelectingDifference.gif" alt = "Select the Difference
    blending mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Select the <b>Difference</b> blending mode.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/LeftmostWaveDifference.png" alt = "Difference color
    blending applied to leftmost wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Difference</b> color blend mode to the
    leftmost wave.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><b>Difference</b> creates the effect of seeing underlying objects as a
  color film negative. Using it subtracts either the overlaying color from the
  underlying color or the underlying color from the overlaying color, depending
  on which one has the greater brightness value. Blending with white inverts
  the underlying color values; blending with black produces no change.</p>
  </li>
  <h4>Screen</h4>
  <li><p>With the leftmost wave still selected (if it isn&rsquo;t, then
  reselect it) select <b>Screen</b> from the dropdown option list.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/SelectingScreen.gif" alt = "Select the Screen
    blending mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Select the <b>Screen</b> blending mode.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/FirstWaveScreen.png" alt = "Screen color
    blending applied to leftmost wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Screen</b> color blend mode to the
    leftmost wave.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><b>Screen</b> multiplies the inverse of the overlying and underlying
  colors. The resulting color is always a lighter color. Screening with black
  leaves the color unchanged, and screening with white produces white. The
  effect is similar to projecting multiple slide images on top of each
  other.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>S</u>ave.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Experiment with the other blending modes available in the dropdown list.
  If you want to undo a color blend, click on the object and then choose
  <b>Normal</b> from the <b>Blend mode</b> dropdown list in the Layers palette.

    <h2>Forthcoming color blending functionality in Inkscape.</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In the interest of putting this tutorial on the Web sooner rather than
  later, I chose not to include sections on blend isolation, blend knockouts,
  and working with opacity masks. These three topics are good graphic design
  techniques for further exploration in development and implementation to add
  to Inkscape&rsquo;s already impressive armada of features and functions.</p>

  <h2>Review Questions</h2>
</header>
<ol>
  <li><p>What is the difference between transparency and opacity?</p>
  <li><p>What is a blending mode and how is it applied?</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Can transparency and color blending be combined?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</section>

  <h2>Review Answers</h2>
</header>
<ol>
  <li><p>Transparency and opacity are opposites of each other. Transparency
  has to do with how much you can see through an object (how transparent it is);
  opacity has to do with how much you can&rsquo;t see through an object, or how
  opaque it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Blending modes allow you to vary the way that colors in objects
  interact or blend with the underlying objects. Modes can be selected from the
  Blend mode dropdown menu in the Layers palette.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Yes, transparency and color blending can be combined to produce a
  broad range of design effects, such as images produced with stained glass,
  tracing paper, lighting effects, and more.</p>
