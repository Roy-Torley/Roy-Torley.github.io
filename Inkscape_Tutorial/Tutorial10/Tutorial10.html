    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll digitally re-create a logo that is
  supplied to you as a low-resolution scan. This is a simple technique
  that can be applied to a multitude of projects including creating
  artwork from photographs, or update your company&rsquo;s logo into a
  scalable vector form that can be used over and over again without
  degradation.</p>

  <p>Before you begin, download and install the font <a href = "wicked-mouse.zip">Wicked Mouse</a>.
  You can also find the Wicked Mouse font on the Internet at
  <a href = "https://www.dafontfree.io/wicked-mouse-font/">https://www.dafontfree.io/wicked-mouse-font/</a>.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll open a file containing the final version of the finished logo
  to see what you are going to create.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Download and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>I</u>mport&hellip; file
  <a href = "images/10_logo_end.gif"><b>10_logo_end.gif</b></a></p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/10_logo_end.gif" alt = "Image of finished
    logo" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Finished logo.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>You will recreate this logo digitally with the Pen tool.</p>
  <p>If you like, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Zoom Out
  to reduce the view of the finished artwork, adjust the window size,
  and leave it on your screen as you work. (Use the Select tool
  (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width
  = "26">) to select and move the artwork where you want it in the
  window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the image open, choose
  <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>C</u>lose.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Download and  <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen, and open file
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/10_logo_start.svg"><b>10_logo_start.svg</b></a>.</p>

      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Starting logo text with no artwork.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <p>Bitmapped files and files from other programs, such as Gimp and
  Photoshop, can be imported into Inkscape and made into a template
  that you can trace over, as if you were working with tracing paper over
  a drawing. In this tutorial, you will import a Portable Document Format (PDF)
  file containing logo and text imagery that you will redraw to create images
  that you can manipulate using Inkscape&rsquo;s tools.</p>

    <h2>Turning an Imported Scan into a Template</h2>
  </header>
<ol>
  <li><p>To begin working, you&rsquo;ll import an existing art file of logo
  artwork that was scanned in. Note that scanners are commonly able to save
  scanned images in Portable Document Format (PDF).</p>
  <p>Download file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/10_Logo_Start.pdf"><b>10_Logo_Start.pdf</b></a>
  and choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>I</u>mport&hellip;. Locate and select
  file <b>10_Logo_Start.pdf</b> and click on the <u>O</u>pen button.</p>
  <p>A <b>PDF Import Settings</b> dialog box appears. Move the slider in the
  <b>Precision of approximating gradient meshes</b> to the extreme left of the
  bar to <b>1.0</b>. You do not need absolute precision in resolution of this
  imagery.</p>

      <img src = "images/PDFImportSettingsDialogBox.gif" alt = "PDF Import
      Settings dialog box" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>PDF Import Settings dialog box. Precision is set to
      <b>1.0</b></figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Click the <u>O</u>K button. The PDF file is imported into the work area.
  Note that it has a bounding box, so it is selected.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/ImportedPDF.gif" alt = "Imported PDF imagery" class =
      "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Imported PDF file of logo and text.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the image into the artboard with the Select tool (<img src =
  "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">). You
  don&rsquo;t have to be exact in placing the image because you&rsquo;ll be
  drawing over it and, once you&rsquo;re done, you will delete it.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/MovePDF.gif" alt = "Moving the PDF imagery" class =

  </li>
  <li><p>This start file contains locked bitmap text for a fish
  supply chain, but not the artwork needed to complete the logo.
  Many times a client provides the only working logo that he or she
  has, and it&rsquo;s already printed &mdash; perhaps even on a
  napkin! With no digital information, you can still recreate the
  client&rsquo;s logo with the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif"
  alt = "Pen tool icon" width = "26">).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip;, name the
  file <b>WVLogo</b>, navigate to a convenient storage location,
  click on the <b>Save</b> button. In the <b>Save as Type</b> option bar,
  leave at the default <b>Inkscape SVG (*.svg)</b> and click
  <u>S</u>ave (Inkscape automatically appends the extension <b>.svg</b>
  to the filename).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The logo and text objects are not aligned. That is how they were
  scanned in. You will make a template out of this imported image and draw new
  workable images on top of it.</p>
  <p>First, you will make the black images partially transparent so you can
  easily distinguish between them and your drawings. With the imagery still
  selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke, and adjust the
  transparency (with the <b>Opacity (%)</b> bar) to <b>50</b>. The imagery
  turns a medium gray color.</p>

    <h2>Creating Custom Guides</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You should be getting an idea of the direction that you are headed. Using
  template layers is very much like the workflow you would use with artwork
  placed underneath a piece of tracing paper.</p>
  <p>Before you start any project that requires some level of accuracy, you
  should set up guides. In this tutorial, you will use standard ruler guides,
  as well as custom guides that you create yourself from pen paths.</p>
  <aside><i><h4>Creating and Using Guidelines</h4>
  <p>Inkscape has two kinds of guides that you can use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard ruler guides are non-printing straight lines that run
    vertically or horizontally on the page.
    </li>
    <li>Guide objects are created by converting an object into a guide.
    This can be helpful when aligning objects on a diagonal line, or if you
    need a shape to be guide.
    </li>
  </ul>
</i></aside>
<ol>
  <li><p>Click and hold on the horizontal ruler. Drag a ruler guide from the
  ruler to the bottom (or baseline) of the placed artwork. Drag another
  guideline to the top of the artwork.</p>
  <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-2 mr-5">
    <img src = "images/DragGuideline2Baseline.png" alt = "Drag horizontal
    guideline to baseline of logo figure" width = "500" class = "img-fluid">

    figure.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <li><p>Click on the vertical ruler and drag out, creating ruler guides to
  surround both sides of the logo.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-4 mr-5">

  <li><p>You&rsquo;ll now create pen paths that will be converted into custom
  guides. This makes it easier to keep angles consistent throughout the artwork.
  The paths that you are creating should overshoot the top and bottom so that
  you can make adjustments to them with less difficulty.</p>
  <p>Select the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool"
  width = "26">) and click below the baseline of the first "V." Then click over
  the top of the "v" following the angle. If you did not get it exactly along
  the angle, switch to the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt
  = "Node tool" width = "26">) and activate the end points individually to
  adjust them.</p>

&lt;Shift&gt;-click on the second path that you created to add it to the
selection.</p>
<p>Instead of creating the other side of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; with the Pen tool
and to avoid risking inaccuracies, you will use the <b>Flip selected objects
horizontally</b> tool (<img src = "images/FlipHorizontally.gif" alt = "Flip
objects horizontally icon" width = "26">) in the Tool Controls Bar.</p>
<p>Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the grouped line segments, then click on

    <h2>Applying the Bend Path Effect</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now that you have recreated the main part of the logo, you can take
  advantage of a path effect that Inkscape offers.</p>
  <ol>
  <li></p>First, select the Rectangle tool (<img src =
  "images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool" width = "26">) and
  create a long thin rectangle that will serve as the first wave stripe across
  the logo. Make one end narrower than the other using the Node tool (<img src
  = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node tool" width = "26">). We chose to
  make the left end narrower than the right.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>With the bar still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt;
  Path Eff<u>e</u>cts. When the <b>Edit Paths</b> dialog box appears, click on
  the <b>Edit on-canvas</b> icon. When the editing tool appears in the wave
  bar, click-drag the bend line with the Node tool cursor into a curve that you
  like. We chose for the line to curve upwards at the left and then down toward
  the right. When done, press &lt;Esc&gt; to deselect the curve.</p>

      <img src = "images/FirstWaveBarBent.gif" alt = "Bending the first bar to

  </li>
  <li><p>Reselect the curve with the Select tool (<img src =

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the curve. While pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key,
  drag the duplicate of the wave straight down to just underneath the original
  curve, then release the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and mouse key. Continue until you
  have about eight individual wavy curves.</p>

    <h2>Arrangement and Stacking Order</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Inkscape stacks sucessively drawn objects, with the first object drawn on
  the bottom, much like a stack of papers on your desk. As you add items to the
  stack, they will cover the previously created objects underneath.</p>

  <p>This arrangement, or stacking order is important not only because it
  affects the way items look when they overlap, but also because the stacking
  order plays a large part in the creation of masks and the way objects appea
  when transparency is applied.</p>

  <p>In this part of the tutorial, you will change object order to create an
  illustration for a fish store.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>A custom guide is different from a ruler guide in that it can be
    created from any path or shape. A ruler guide is only horizontal or
    vertical and is created by dragging the guide from the rulers.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To make a scan into a template, it is best to scan it and save the
    image as a bitmap image file. Then choose <u>F</u>ile &gt;
    <u>I</u>mport&hellip;, place it on the artboard or where you want to
    position it. Select the image, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject
    Properties&hellip;, check the <b>L<u>o</u>ck</b> checkbox to prevent it from
    being modified accidentally. Using guides and the Pen tool (<img src =
    "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool" width = "26">), re-create the
    placed scan. When you have finished redrawing the image, choose
    <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unlock All. Delete the original scan image.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Raise the current layer</b> will only bring the selected layer
    ahead of the layer created right beneath it in the layer stacking order.
    This is not the same as <b>Raise the current layer to the top</b>, which
    will immediately place the selected layer at the very top of the stacking
    order.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When you are creating a clipping mask, the object acting as the mask
    must be at the top of the object or layer stacking order. Always make sure
    by selecting the object and choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Raise to <u>T</u>op,
    or by clicking on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon in the Tool
    Controls Bar, or by having the clipping mask object in its own layer and
    having that layer be topmost in the layer stack.</p>
