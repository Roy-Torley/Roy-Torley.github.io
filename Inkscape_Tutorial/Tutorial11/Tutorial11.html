    <h2>Creating a Gradient Fill</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Gradients can be used very much like colors to fill objects that you
  create. A gradient fill is a graduated blend between two or more colors. You
  can easily create your own gradients, or you can use the gradients provided
  with Inkscape and edit them for the desired effect.</p>
  <p>To begin the tutorial, you&rsquo;ll create a gradient fill for one of the
  chili peppers.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), click to select the chili
    pepper in the back.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The pepper is painted with a solid color fill and no stroke, as
    indicated in the Fill and Stroke boxes at the bottom of the toolbox.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
      <img src = "images/BackChiliSelected.gif" alt = "Back chili is selected."
      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The back chili is selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
      <img src = "images/ChiliSolidFillNoStroke.png" alt = "Back chili has a
      solid fill and no stroke." width = "400" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The Fill and Stroke boxes show that<br>the back chili has a
      solid fill and no stroke.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke&hellip;, and click
    on the <b>Linear gradient</b> tab in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel that
    appears.</p>
    <p>Your example might show a gradient background of black grading into
    transparency or another combination of colors if you have already been
    working with gradients. The example here shows the original of the chili
    grading into transparency as an artifact of previous experiments. Note that
    the Fill and Stroke boxes now show that a gradient has been applied and no
    stroke.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-2 mr-4">
      <img src = "images/BackChiliGradientApplied.gif" alt = "Back chili has a
      gradient now and no stroke." width = "700" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The back chili now has a linear gradient applied (no
      stroke).</figcaption>
    </figure>
      <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/GradientAppliedNoStroke.png" alt = "Back chili has a
        gradient now and no stroke." width = "250" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The Fill and Stroke boxes show a gradient fill<br>(no
        stroke).</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <li><p>In the Fill and Stroke panel, click on the <b>Edit Gradient</b>
    icon (<img src = "images/EditGradientIcon.gif" alt = "Edit gradient icon"
    width = "26">) just below the Gradient library listing. An <b>Edit
    Gradient</b> tool appears as a rectangle enclosing the chili with a
    gradient adjustment tool (line segment with end handles) inside. The square
    and circle that end the line segment represent what are called <b>gradient
    stops</b>, or just <b>stops</b>, where one color starts (the square handle)
    and the other ends (at the circular handle). The Select tool cursor changes
    into the <b>Edit Gradient</b> cursor (<img src =
    "images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt = "Edit gradient cursor" width =
    "26">).</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/EditGradientTool.png" alt = "Edit Gradient tool"
      width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Edit gradient tool with gradient stops.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <aside><h4>Important! How the Gradient Tool works.</h4>
    <p>Note that the Linear Gradient tool uses the fill color you last used.
    Otherwise, the color defaults to black. The fill color starts out at <u>full
    opacity under the square stop</u>, and then grades to <u>full transparency
    under the circular stop</u>. You need to remember this behavior of the
    Gradient tool.</p>
    <p>To end the gradient in a different color, make a duplicate of the object
    you want to attach a gradient to and give it a solid fill color that is the
    color at the end stop. Using the <b>Lower selection one step</b> tool (<img
    src = "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection one step
    tool" width = "26">) in the Tool Controls Bar or pressing the &lt;PgDn&gt;
    key, lower the solid fill color copy of the object to underneath the
    original object with the gradient. The result is an object filled with a
    color-to-color gradient.</p>
  </aside>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the square stop with the <b>Edit Gradient cursor</b> (<img
    src = "images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt = "Edit gradient cursor" width =
    "26">). The square stop turns blue to show that it is active.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>In the <b>Fill</b> palette in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel,
    click on the <b>RGB</b> tab (<u>R</u>ed <u>G</u>reen <u>B</u>lue) if that
    palette isn&rsquo;t selected already.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Enter these RGB values in the Color palette: <b>R = 204</b>, <b>G =
    0</b>, <b>B = 51</b>, and <b>A = 255</b>. (Press &lt;Tab&gt; to select each
    text box.) Press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to apply the last value
    typed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now make a duplicate of the chili. This copy will contain
    the fill color that represents the end of the gradient. With the Select
    tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon"
    width = "26">) active, select the chili and make a duplicate of it with
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D or by choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; Duplic<u>a</u>te. Note that
    the duplicated chili adds to the overall darkness of the gradient because
    there are two gradient chilis, one ontop of the other.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/GradientChiliDuplicated.gif" alt = "The gradient
        chili is now duplicated." class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Duplicated chili ontop of the original gradient chili. Note
        that the gradient has darkened because there are now two
        chilies.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the duplicate chili still selected, click on the <b>Flat
    color</b> icon (<img src = "images/FlatColorIcon.gif" alt = "Flat color
    icon" width = "26">) in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel. The selected chili
    takes on the solid color that starts the gradient of the original chili.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/SelectedChiliSolidColor.gif" alt = "The duplicate chili
      now has a solid color." class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The duplicated chili now has a solid color.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The selected chili is ready to become the end portion of the
      gradient. With the <b>Flat color</b> tool active, click on the <b>RGB</b>
      button if it is not already selected.</p>
      <p>Change the ending color by entering these values in the Color palette:
      <b>R = 0</b>, <b>G = 179</b>, <b>B = 0</b>, and <b>A = 255</b>. (Press
      Tab to select each text box.) Press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to
      apply the last value typed. The resulting green color will define the end
      stop of the gradient.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>Press the &lt;PgDn&gt; key 7 times to (eventually) place the green
    chili directly underneath the original chili with the gradient. The

    <h2>Adjusting the Direction of the Gradient Blend</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Once you have painted an object with a gradient fill, you can adjust the
  direction that the gradient colors blend in the object. Now you&rsquo;ll
  adjust the gradient fill in the other chili pepper.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to select the chili pepper in front.
    Notice that it&rsquo;s painted with a radial-type gradient (as indicated in
    the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/FrontChiliSelected.gif" alt = "Front chili selected"
        class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Front chili selected.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You can create linear or radial gradients. Both types of gradient have
      a starting and an ending color of the fill. With a radial gradient, the
      starting color of the gradient defines the center point of the fill,
      which radiates outward to the ending color.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the <b>Gradient</b> tool, which is one of the hidden
    tools at the bottom of the toolbox. The <b>Radial gradient</b> tool
    automatically appears over the selected chili.</p>
      <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
        <img src = "images/GradientToolIcon.gif" alt = "Gradient tool icon"
        class = "img-fluid">

        <figcaption>Front chili with Gradient tool</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
      <p>The <b>Gradient</b> tool works only on selected objects that are
      filled with a gradient.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click or drag the <b>Gradient</b> tool across the selected chili
    pepper to change the position and direction of the gradient&rsquo;s
    starting and ending colors. You move the entire <b>Gradient</b> tool when
    you drag the square handle. You rotate the orientation of the radial
    gradient, and extend or shorten the gradient effect when you drag one or
    the other cirular handle.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MoveGradientTool.gif" alt = "Moving the Gradient
        tool" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving the <b>Gradient</b> tool.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For example, drag within the pepper to create a short gradient with
      distinct color blends; drag a longer distance outside the pepper to
      create a longer gradient with more subtle color blends. You can also drag
      from the ending color to the starting color and vice versa to transpose
      the colors and reverse the direction of the blend as you can see
      below.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MoveGradientTool2.gif" alt = "Moving the Gradient
        tool some more" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving the <b>Gradient</b> tool some more.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Deselect the artwork by choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; D<u>e</u>select,
    and then choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>S</u>ave.</p>
    <p>If you experimented with changing the direction of the gradient and want
    to revert to the prior direction, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or click on the
    <b>Undo</b> icon (<img src = "images/UndoIcon.gif" alt = "Undo icon" width
    = "26">) in the <b>Commands Bar</b> until you arrive back at the original
    placement of the gradient.</p>
    </li>

  <header><h2>Adding Colors to a Gradient</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Every gradient in Inkscape has at least two gradient stops. By editing
  the color mix of each stop and by adding gradient stops in the Gradient
  palette, you can create your own custom gradients.</p>
  <p>Now you&rsquo;ll paint some type that has been converted to paths with a
  linear gradient fill, and edit the colors in it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), &lt;Shift&gt;-click each of the
    letters to group-select them in the type CHILES.</p>
    <p>The CHILES type has already been converted to paths so you can fill it
    with a gradient. (To convert type to paths, select it and choose <u>P</u>ath
    &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path. See Lesson 8, "Working with Type," for more
    information.)</p>

    objects</b> icon (<img src = "images/GroupSelectedObjectsIcon.gif" alt =
    "Group selected objects icon" width = "26">) to group the letters.</p>
    <p>By grouping the letters, you&rsquo;ll fill each individual letter with
    the same gradient at once. Grouping them also makes it easier to edit the
    gradient fill globally.</p>

    <h2>Blending Intermediate Steps</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll create a series of blended shapes between
  three different-colored shapes on the outside of the bowl by specifying the
  number of steps in the blend and using the <b>Generate from Path -
  Interpolate</b> extension tool to create the blend.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>First, group-select the red and yellow diamonds below the rim
    of the bowl with &lt;Shift&gt;-click. Then, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt;
    <u>O</u>bject to Path.</p>
    <p>The <b>Interpolate</b> tool works only on paths, so any shape like a
    circle, square, or other shape created with a shape tool needs to be
    converted to a path in order for it to work smoothly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ConvertDiamonds2Paths.gif" alt = "Convert the
        diamond shapes to paths." class = "img-fluid">

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Exte<u>n</u>sions &gt; Generate from Path &gt;
    Interpolate&hellip;</p>
    <p>When the <b>Interpolate</b> dialog box appears, set <b>Interpolation
    steps</b> to <b>6</b> to create six intermediate shapes, set
    <b>Interpolation method</b> to <b>1</b> (method 2 is an alternative
    algorithm for blending if method 1 doesn&rsquo;t work), check the
    <b>Interpolate style</b> checkbox, and leave the <b>Duplicate endpoints</b>
    and <b>Use Z-order</b> checkboxes unchecked. However, check the <b>Live
    preview</b> checkbox so you can see the blend result before you actually
    apply blending.</p>
    <figure>

      blend." class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Previewing the Interpolate 1 blend.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The result is a sequence of eight diamonds, including the original
    beginning and ending diamonds, that changes step-wise in color and size.
    The transition in attributes (color and size) is smooth from start to
    finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click the <u>A</u>pply button, and then the <u>C</u>lose button.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The sequence of diamonds is a grouping of the two end diamonds as one
  group and the six intermediate diamonds as the other group.</p>
  <p>With the diamonds still selected, click on the <b>Ungroup selected

  <li><p>Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose Exte<u>n</u>sions &gt; Generate from Path &gt;
  Interpolate&hellip;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>As you did before, set <b>Interpolation steps</b> to <b>6</b>, set
  <b>Interpolation method</b> to <b>1</b>, check the <b>Interpolate style</b>
  checkbox, leave the <b>Duplicate endpoints</b> and <b>Use Z-order</b>
  checkboxes unchecked, but check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox.</p>

  <li><p>The blended decorations need to be properly spaced and aligned along
  a curve that parallels the edge of the bowl. You will ungroup them (the

    <h2>Combining Blends with Gradients</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can blend objects that are filled with gradients to create different
  effects of color blending. The two zigzag lines in the artwork are filled
  with gradients.</p>
  <p>Now, you&rsquo;ll blend the gradient-filled lines to create a multicolored
  blend in the artwork. The theme of this particular design is a yellow
  stripe diagonally crossing an area of dark blue zigzag lines.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>First, set guidelines on all four sides of the block of space that
    includes the two zigzag lines. These guidelines will serve to reposition
    the filled block of zigzag lines you will create. You will move the two
    zigzag lines outside of the artwork so you can work without any distracting
    background. When you have finished with this section&rsquo;s task, you will
    move the zigzag line block back into the artwork exactly back into its
    original location. The guidelines will help you do this.</p>

  to end and intermediate stop markers as you see fit.</p>
  <p>When you bring the two intermediate markers closer together, you make the
  width of the yellow strip narrower. You change the character of color
  blending when you drag the end markers further away from the gradient block
  you&rsquo;re working on.</p>

<p>You have finished this tutorial on blending colors to make gradients and
blending objects to make object blends. You now have experience on combining
the blending gradients and objects to enhance and broaden your graphic
design skills.</p>
<p>Experiment with different widths of the yellow stripe, the length of the
gradient tool bar, and adding different colors to the gradient. Let this
project serve as an initial idea of what you can do with color gradients and
object blending.</p>

  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>A gradient fill is a graduated blend between two or more colors or
    tints of the same color.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Select an object and do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Linear gradient</b> button or <b>Radial gradient</b>
        button in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel to fill an object with the
        default white-to-black gradient or with the last selected gradient.
        </li>
        <li>Click a gradient swatch in the gradient library palette, also in the
        <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel.
        </li>
        <li>Use the <b>Pick colors from image</b> tool (<img src =
        "images/DropperCursor.gif" alt = "Pick colors icon" width = "26">) to
        sample a gradient from an object in your artwork, and then apply it to
        the selected object.
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>The difference between a gradient fill and a blend is the way that
    colors combine together &ndash; colors blend together within a gradient
    fill and between objects in a blend.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You drag one of the gradient&rsquo;s stops on the <b>Gradient</b>
    tool bar.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Double-click where you want to add the new color on the
    <b>Gradient</b> tool bar with the <b>Edit gradient</b> cursor active (<img
    src = "images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt = "Edit gradient cursor" width =
    "26">) active. Then, with the <b>Gradient</b> tool icon (<img
     src = "images/DropperCursor.gif" alt = "Pick colors icon" width = "26">)
     active, click on the color you want to add.</p>
   </li>
    <li><p>You click or drag the beginning or ending stop marker of the
    <b>Gradient</b> tool bar with the <b>Edit gradient</b> cursor (<img src =
    "images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt = "Edit gradient cursor" width = "26">)
    to adjust the direction of a gradient. Make sure that the gradient stop
    marker you want is blue, showing that it is active. Dragging a long
    distance changes colors gradually; dragging a short distance makes the
    color change more abrupt.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You first group-select the objects that will share a common gradient
    among them and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group them into one object. While
    the grouped objects are still selected, bring up the <b>Fill and Stroke</b>
    panel, click on the <b>Linear gradient</b> button (<img src =
    "images/LinearGradientButton.gif" alt = "Linear gradient button" width =
    "26">) or <b>Radial gradient</b> button (<img src =
    "images/RadialGradientButton.gif" alt = "Radial gradient button" width =
    "26">), click on the <b>Edit gradient</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/EditGradientIcon.gif" alt = "Edit gradient icon" width = "26">),
    and then adjust colors and direction as you see fit.</p>
    </li>
