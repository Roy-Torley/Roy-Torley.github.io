  <p>In this tutorial, you will continue applying different styles of paint
  brush and drawing pencil to a template file you were working on in the last
  tutorial, Tutorial 14, Part A. You will work with the Calligraphy Pen tool
  and learn how to create a ripple texture. You will also learn some of the
  critical thinking techniques to analyze and then create complex shapes.</p>

    <h2>Using Calligraphic Brushes</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Calligraphic brushes resemble strokes drawn using different types of
  calligraphic pen. Pen types and styles include the <b>Dip pen</b>,
  <b>Marker</b>, <b>Brush</b>, <b>Wiggly</b>, <b>Splotchy</b>, and
  <b>Tracing</b>. The <b>No preset</b> option allows you to create your own
  pen style.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll use a Calligraphic pen to draw water ripples in front of the
  canoe. You&rsquo;ll begin by creating a custom brush. You will then choose a
  color for the brush strokes you will have drawn.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the <b>Calligraphy Pen</b> tool icon (<img src =
    "images/CalligraphyToolIcon.gif" alt = "Calligraphy Pen tool icon" width
    = "26">) in the toolbox. The <b>Calligraphy Pen Tool Controls Bar</b>

  </li>
  <li><p>You will make create a new Calligraphic Pen preset option for making
  lines and curves that represent ripples. As you draw a curve, the thickness
  will vary subtley, which is desirable in this case. The various settings you
  make will be saved as a pen preset option.</p>
  <p>Set the <b>Width = 8</b>, keep the <b>Thinning</b> at <b>0</b>, set the
  <b>Angle = 45</b>, <b>Fixation = 75</b>, and <b>Caps</b> and <b>Tremor</b>
  to <b>0</b>.</p>
  <p>Click on the Down arrow (<img src = "images/DownArrow.gif" alt = "Downward
  pointing arrow" width = "26">) at the right of the <b>Calligraphic Pen Tool
  bar</b> to bring up the <b>Pen mass</b> dialog box. We chose <b>Mass = 4</b>
  to make the pen stroke lag behind a little bit in speed compared to the speed
  at which you will be drawing to help smoothen the curve.</p>
  <p>Click on the <b>Add or edit calligraphic profile</b> icon (<img src =
  "images/AddEditCalligraphicProfileIcon.gif" alt = "Add or edit calligraphic
  profile icon" width = "26">) at the left end of the <b>Calligraphic Pen Tool
  Bar</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Enter <b>Ripple</b> in the <b>Edit profile</b> dialog box that
  appears. Click on the <b>Save</b> button. You can now use this calligraphic
  pen option whenever you want for this particular artwork. Just click on the
  <b>Choose a preset</b> button and select <b>Ripple</b>. The Calligraphic Pen
  tool will be configured to draw ripples.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>With the <b>Calligraphic Pen</b> tool, <b>Ripple</b> option active,
  trace over the three guides for the ripples. If you don't like what you see,
  delete and redraw. Try increasing the mass of the pen. The Calligraphic Pen
  tool will react more slowly as you draw, which is the point with this option.
  A slower interaction time might help you draw a smoother line or curve.</p>

    <h2>Drawing Rope Using the <i>Pattern Along Path</i> Function</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Drawing rope seems to be a simple task of taking a single roll of cord and
  duplicating it along the length of a path that represents the rope itself.
  To make a length of rope in which all the rolls fit into each other in a
  continuous sequence can be tedious, however, requiring an understanding of
  symmetry and how to make it work for you. The tedium is reduced when you
  break the task down into smaller steps that are easier to manage. The ability
  to take a large problem and reduce it into a collection of smaller, simpler
  steps is a very important skill to cultivate in graphic design. You can
  create very sophisticated and awe-inspiring artwork when you use critical
  thinking like this.</p>
  <p>You will make a length of doubled rope that is tied to the boat and leads
  up to the trunk of the tree. Then, you will make a visually separate length
  of rope that circles the trunk of the tree.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>First, select the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Pen tool icon" width = "26">) and create a smooth curve that follows the
    guideline from the boat to the knot at the tree trunk.</p>
    <p>Click on a starting point of the rope guideline and drag the Pen tool
    cursor (<img src = "images/PenToolCursor.gif" alt = "Pen tool cursor" width
    = "26">) out in the direction that the curve is to go.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope01.gif" alt = "Starting to draw the rope curve"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Clicking on a starting point and dragging the direction<br>
        handle out in the direction of the curve.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Release the left mouse button and then click on the ending point of
    the curve. Note how the curve follows the cursor and is then set when you
    click on the ending point.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope02.gif" alt = "Defining the ending point of the
        rope curve" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Defining the ending point of the rope curve.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">). Position the Node tool cursor over the
    rope curve until the hand icon appears. Click-drag the curve out until it
    matches the curvature of the guideline underneath. Adjust with the two
    direction handles at either end of the curve for fine adjustment, if
    necessary.</p>
      <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
        <img src = "images/Rope03.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">

        handle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <li><p>You will now transform the rope curve into a path that represents
    a doubled rope, that is, a rope path that doubles back on itself smoothly
    at each end.</p>
    <p>Select the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) and choose Objects &gt; Fill and
    Stroke&hellip;. Click on the <b>Stroke style</b> tab, enter a <b>Width</b>
    of <b>3.2 px</b>, and click on the <b>Round cap</b> button (<img src =
    "images/RoundCapButton.gif" alt = "Round cap button" width = "26">).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope05.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Rope curve with a width of 3.2 pixels and ends having

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the curve still selected, choose Path &gt; Stroke to Path.</p>
    <p>You will see nothing different in the curve, but Inkscape now
    &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the curve only as a simple curve without any previous
    shape information that it was a line segment.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">) to view the nodes that demarcate the newly
    created path from the curve stroke.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope06.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Nodes visible on the newly created path.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>To see the path better, change the stroke width to <b>0.200 px</b>,
    set the stroke color to black (&lt;Shift&gt;-click on the black swatch in
    the Color palette at the bottom of the working window), and click on the
    <b>none</b> swatch (<img src = "images/None.gif" alt = "No color" width =
    "26">) at the left end of the Color palette to set the curve&rsquo;s fill
    color to <b>none</b> (or transparent).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope07.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">

    <li><p>Select the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) if it isn&rsquo;t active
    already, and press &lt;Esc&gt; to deselect the path.</p>
    <p>The path doubles back on itself at the ends. The <b>Round cap</b>
    option that you selected earlier creates smooth turn-arounds that the coils
    that you will shortly make can follow, enhancing the flexible look of
    rope.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Rope08.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">

    <li><p>Reselect the path with the Select tool (<img src =

    and choose Path &gt; Stroke to Path. <b><u>Do not</u></b> choose Path &gt;
    <u>Object to Path</u>. You will get spurious rope coils that do not appear
    right when you apply the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function later in this
    tutorial.</p>
    <p>The path is now ready to receive the pattern of a rope coil that will be
    duplicated along the path&rsquo;s length.</p>

    <h2>Drawing Rope &mdash; How to Analyze a Complex Shape</h2>
  </header>
  <h4>The Geometry of Rope</h4>
  <p>When one thinks of rope, one envisions a cord of any length consisting of
  coiled cotton, nylon, wire, or any other material that can make lengths of
  strong, usually resilient material. See below.<p>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
  <img src = "images/RopePic1.jpg" alt = "Rope example 1" class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
  <img src = "images/RopePic2.jpg" alt = "Rope example 2" class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left:">
  <img src = "images/RopePic3.webp" alt = "Rope example 3" width = "600"
  class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>The examples above have one feature in common: they all are made of coiled
  material. That basic coil feature, we&rsquo;ll call it a <b>motif</b>, is
  repeated along the length of the rope and informs us, when we see it, that we
  are looking at cord or rope. It is our challenge to replicate that coiled look
  to inform the person viewing our artwork that he or she is looking at rope or
  cord.</p>
  <p>Here is where geometry, the study of shapes, comes in handy to inform
  our sense of how to do precise design. By the way, this section does not
  discuss geometry as is done in a mathematics course. We do need, however, to
  look closely at shapes with an analytical frame of mind so that we can create
  the kind of imagery that has meaning and makes sense to the viewer.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll start by looking at the drawing of a piece of rope.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a section of rope or cord up close. The
    small-scale feature that leaps out of the picture is the coils. These coils
    all look exactly alike. As a graphic designer, this repetition of shape
    is a geometric constraint, a limit if you will, that will help us immensely.
    If you consider one coil, you consider them all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory1.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>A section of rope.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li>These coils are not just exact replicas of each other, their sides are
    curved just right so that they fit exactly against each other. This is
    another constraint that can help us understand how this kind of repetitive
    design works.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory2.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Each coil has matching side curvature.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Another characteristic of the coils is that they still look exactly
    alike when they are rotated 180 degrees. This feature is called <i>two-fold
    rotational symmetry</i>. Two-fold, three-fold, four-fold, and six-fold
    symmetry are terms used in geometry, engineering, crystallography, and
    other analytical disciplines that use symmetry as a tool for understanding
    and communicating about shapes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory3.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Two-fold rotational symmetry.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Because coils have two-fold rotational symmetry and their sides have
    the same curvature, each side has two-fold symmetry across its midpoint.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory4.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Opposite sides having the same curvature.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>As a result, we need to consider only one half of a coil&rsquo;s
    shape.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory5.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The lower half of the sequence of coils can be
        removed with no loss of design information.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the lower half of the coils removed, we still see the
    repetitive symmetry of the upper half, and that opposite sides still
    match.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory6.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Top half of coils, all important shape information still
        present.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The exact sameness of the sides, and the top, of each coil allows us
    to divide a coil-half into two complementary halves, as drawn in the figure
    below.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory7.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Each coil half divided into two complementary
        halves.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>When the coil halves are placed next to each other, a simpler
    symmetry appears.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory8.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Regrouping coil halves to highlight a simpler
        symmetry.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake (pun intentional), consider just one
    coil half.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory9.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>One upper half of a coil.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the lower left section of the coil half to the lower right.
    Because the two sides have the exact same curvature, they fit together
    exactly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Theory11.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Exact fit of opposing sides.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The two combined sides make the curved diagonal of a rectangle. The
    curved top of the rectangle and the curved diagonal can be straightened
    out.</p>
    <p>Now we can see how, by simplifying a complex shape into basic
    components of simpler symmetry, we can understand how the original shape is
    put together and, importantly, how we can use Inkscape tools and functions
    to construct that shape out of motifs of simple symmetry.</p>

  <p>This section can serve as an introduction to the theory of graphic design.
  The main point is the importance of critical thinking, which in this case,
  helps you to take a complicated problem, like a rope coil, divide it into
  smaller, more manageable parts, and use those pieces to understand what is
  happening behind the scenes in terms of geometry, symmetry, and what Inkscape
  can do for you in drawing them.</p>
  <p>If you don&rsquo;t like mathematics, there is no problem here. You are
  working strictly with shapes. Numbers will help when you need them, but for
  now, the ability to envision using your mental screen and Inkscape on an
  actual screen is what&rsquo;s important. Then, let the power of your
  imagination take over.</p>

    <h2>Drawing Rope &mdash; Using Shape Analysis to Guide Your Drawing</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now that you know what&rsquo;s involved with doing shape analysis, you will
  use your newly acquired insight to draw a length of rope showing visible
  coils. This section is a variation on the theme of the last section, the
  variation being that you will go through the last section from end to
  beginning, using Inkscape to draw each step of the way until you have created
  a full length of rope.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The rope starts with a triangle. Draw a triangle using the Pen tool
    (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool icon" width = "26">).
    The triangle drawn below has a long leg of 11 pixels&rsquo; length and the
    short leg is 9 pixels long. These measurements are not hard and fast &mdash;
    we chose them arbitrarily to make a nice-looking coil, and thus a
    nice-looking length of rope.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeRope01.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The starting triangle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The coil will eventually be colored before creating the final length
    of rope. At this time, we need a color (we chose Fuchsia here) to see the
    triangle and differentiate from the other pieces of the coil shape that
    we&rsquo;ll create shortly. Choose <b>none</b> for the stroke color.
    We&rsquo;ll give the final coil shape a stroke color later.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeRope02.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Fuchsia color fill, no color for the stroke.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">), and then click on the triangle with the
    Node tool cursor (<img src = "images/NodeToolCursor.gif" alt = "Node tool
    cursor" width = "26">). Corner nodes and thin lines appear, ready for
    manipulation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeRope03.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Triangle in Node tool view.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the Node tool cursor (<img src = "images/NodeToolCursor.gif"
    alt = "Node tool cursor" width = "26">) to the hypotenuse (the longest leg)
    until a hand icon appears next to the cursor. The hand means that the
    cursor is now above an object that can be manipulated by the tool.</p>
    <p>Click on the hypotenuse to select it and then click-drag it a little to
    the upper left to give it a gentle curve. (By how much is up to you.)</p>
    <p>This curve will generate both the left and right side curves of the
    coil.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>Repeat the previous step with the top (long) leg of the triangle
    also, to give it a gentle curve.</p>
    <p>This curve will serve as the top and bottom parts of the coil shape,
    demarcating where the rope stops and the rest of the artwork begins. Right
    now, it just looks like a stylized eagle claw &mdash; but not for long!</p>

    <p>Start by selecting the Rectangle tool (<img src =

    <p>Click-drag the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleToolIcon.gif"

    to cover it with a rectangle. Let the top curve remain uncovered. We turned
    the View &gt; Page Grid feature off &mdash; it is no longer necessary.</p>
    <p>We chose blue for the fill color of the rectangle from the Color palette
    so that it is distinguishable from the talon shape.</p>

    <li><p>You will now divide the image stack into two parts: the original
    talon shape and the complementary part of the rectangle <u>not

    to do this.</p>
    <p>With the rectangle still selected (reselect it if it has been
    deselected), choose Path &gt; Object to Path. This step is necessary for
    what&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
    <p>&lt;Shift&gt;-click in the talon shape to group-select it with
    the rectangle. You will see two horizontal bounding box line segments: one
    demarcating the top of the rectangle, and the other touching the curved
    top of the overlying talon shape.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeRope12.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Group-selecting the rectangle and talon
        shapes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>Path difference</b> function operates by taking the top of
    two path objects and using it like a cookie-cutter on the shape underneath.
    The operation eliminates the cookie-cutter shape but keeps the shape that
    was cut.</p>
    <p>The <b>Path difference</b> function does not work on regular objects; it
    works <u>only</u> on paths. So, before using this function, make sure that
    both the cookie-cutter top shape has been converted into a path and the
    object underneath has also been converted using Path &gt; Object to Path or
    Path &gt; Stroke to Path, depending on the kind of object that needs to be
    converted. Then, do your cookie-cutting.</p>
    <p>Choose Path &gt; Difference. Click-drag the lower shape away from the
    talon. The duplicate talon that cookie-cut the rectangle has been
    eliminated, but the original talon at the bottom of the image stack remains.
    This technique of duplicating an image and using one as a cookie-cutter is
    great for creating shapes that need to complement each other&rsquo;s
    geometry and where you need both shapes available.</p>

    <li><p>Next, resize the coil motif so that it does not interfere with
    duplicates located on the path representing the opposite length of rope.
    If the motif is too large, tops of one side will overlap the bottoms of
    the other side, producing an unrealistic and unsightly effect.<p>
    <p>A good technique is to resize the motif using the spacing between
    adjacent path curves so that it just fits inside.</p>
    <p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), select the motif, click-drag it so
    that it sits over the rope path, and resize it using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag on a
    sizing handle (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag allows you to resize an object and
    maintain its aspect ratio so it is not distorted). Resize it so that it
    just fits inside the space or is a little smaller. Resizing the motif this
    way allows it to be duplicated along the rope path without interfering with
    the other motifs on the other side of the path.</p>

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>Pattern along Path</b> function needs to know a few things
    about the motif: how wide the bounding box is, by how much do you need to
    shift a duplicate so it fits just right against an adjacent motif, and
    whether the motif is oriented horizontally or vertically.</p>
    <p>The geometry of the motif is such that its central width is one third of
    the width of the bounding box. That is how the motif was constructed. You
    can find the width of the motif by using the <b>Measure</b> tool.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>Hidden tools</b> arrow (<img src =
    "images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt = "Hidden tools arrow" width = "26">)
    at the bottom of the toolbox, and then select <b>Measure</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the <b>Measure tool</b> cursor (<img src =
    "images/MeasureToolCursor.gif" alt = "Measure tool cursor" width = "26">),
    click on one side of the motif along its center line (use a guideline if
    needed) and then click on the other side. A very nice feature of the
    <b>Measure</b> tool is that it can measure the width or height of an object,
    as seen in the figure below.</p>
    <p>The coil motif has a central width of 1.60 pixels. This is fortuitous
    for this tutorial because the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function does not
    work with feature resolutions finer than a tenth of a pixel. A width of
    1.60 pixels can be reexpressed as 1.6 pixels &mdash; the <b>0</b> can be
    discarded &mdash; so this measurement is at the level of resolution that
    the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function can work with. Remember this number
    of <b>1.6 pixels</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If your measurement has a number not zero in the last place,
    for example, <b>1.64 px</b>, then resize the motif and remeasure its width
    with the <b>Measure</b> tool until you see a width with a <b>0</b> in the
    last place.</p>

    deformation</b>.</p>
    <p>Check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox to view the first set of
    duplicated coil motifs on the rope path. There is space for two more sets

    <h2>Drawing the Second Rope with the <i>Pattern Along Path</i> Function</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Half of the work has already been done for this section: the rope coil
  motif has already been made and is just the right size for the rope path you
  will create. Inkscape remembers that the motif has the top-of-the-image-stack
  marker you gave it in the last section. You just have to make the rope path
  and put the coil motif on it via the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start drawing the rope path with the Pen tool (<img src =
    "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen tool icon" width = "26">).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SecondRope01.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Starting to draw the rope path.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Using the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">), put in the curves and do the
    fine-adjustments you want so that the path looks smooth and
    &ldquo;ropey.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Increase the path&rsquo;s width to 3.2 pixels as you had done in the last
    section.</p>

        <figcaption>Making the rope path smooth and increasing its width to
        3.2 pixels.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Choose Path &gt; Stroke to Path. Do <u>not</u> choose Path &gt;
    Object to Path. You will see spurious copies of the coil motif when you
    use the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">). Select the rope path if it has
    been deselected, click on the <b>none</b> swatch (<img src =

    the path will have no color fill, &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the black swatch
    so the stroke path will appear, and set the stroke width to <b>0.2
    px</b>.</p>

</section>
<p>You have now finished the second part of this three-part tutorial. You
learned what&rsquo;s involved with critically thinking through a complex shape,
here, a rope with coils. You deconstructed the rope into individual coils, and
a coil into related shapes that share side curvatures and side lengths. Then,
you reconstructed a couple of rope shapes by retracing the theoretical steps
you took earlier, from end to beginning, to draw a believable rope image,
coils and all.</p>
<p>This kind of critical thinking opens up a whole new arena of understanding
and drawing shapes, with pencil, pen, Inkscape, or another computer drawing
program. You don&rsquo;t have to be a mathematician &mdash; you just need a
basic understanding of how the symmetry of shapes can help you develop a graphic
design version of X-ray vision and help you choose the tools that work best
for you.</p>
<p>In Tutorial 14, Part C, you will learn how to simulate pencil and pen
scribble strokes as if you actually had colored pencils and pens and were just
quickly filling in colors, among a couple of other techniques.</p>

    <h2>Review Questions</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li>What is the purpose of the Calligraphy tool mass control?
    </li>
    <li>Does the <b>Pattern Along Paths</b> function accept objects, paths, or
    both to lay out a pattern along a path?
    </li>
    <li>What does two-fold symmetry mean? What are some examples of two-fold
    symmetry?
    </li>
    <li>What might happen if the <b>Tangential offset</b> is lower than the
    ideal value for a sequence of <b>Pattern Along Path</b> duplicates?
    </li>
    <li>What is the value of critical thinking in graphic design?
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The Pen tool mass control slows down the reaction of the Calligraphy
    tool to the rate of speed at which you draw. The higher the mass value, the
    more slowly the pen stroke moves behind the Calligraphy tool cursor. This
    simulates drawing with a heavy pen, although there is no real weight.
    However, wiggles and jiggles caused from small hand movements are reduced,
    resulting in a smoother stroke.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>Pattern Along Paths</b> function accepts <u>only</u> paths.
    The pattern to be applied to a path has to be converted to a path, by
    choosing either Path &gt; Object to Path or Path &gt; Stroke to Path,
    depending upon the nature of the pattern. The same thing goes for the path
    that the pattern follows.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Two-fold symmetry means that you can take an object, rotate it by
    180 degrees about an axis of rotation, and you&rsquo;ll see the exact same
    thing again.</p>
    <p>Examples of two-fold symmetry include a rectangle, a diamond shape
    <b>&loz;</b>, the letters <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>
    (non-stylized), <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>. There is an infinity of other
    examples.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If the <b>Tangential offset</b> value is too small, duplicated
    objects might overlap, possibly producing an unsightly effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Critical thinking is a structured way of looking at a complicated
    problem, say, an image, by breaking it down into smaller image chunks that
    are easier to understand and work with. In graphic design, these small
    pieces of the problem can show you symmetry where it looked like none
    existed before. These smaller parts of the problem can help you gain
    insight into how you can solve it as you find techniques, here,
    Inkscape techniques and tools that can work for you each step along the way
    toward a solution.</p>
