  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
</header>
<p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll transform parts of a logo to use in three
pieces of artwork to create a letterhead design, an envelope, and a business
card template.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Download and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Composite.svg"><b>Composite.svg</b></a>.
  This file contains a composite of the three pieces of finished artwork. The
  Citrus Bath &amp; Soap logo in the top left corner of the letterhead is the
  basis for all the modified objects. The logo has been resized for the
  letterhead, envelope, and business card.</p>

  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> You can also view the individual pieces of finished
  artwork by downloading and opening files
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg</b></a>,
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07Envelope.svg"><b>Tutorial07Envelope.svg</b></a>,
  and <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg</b></a>.</p>
	</aside>

  </li>
  <li><p>If you like, use the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt =
  "Zoom In/Out tool" width = "26">) to reduce the view of the finished artwork,
  adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen as you work. (Use the
  mouse wheel with and without pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key to move the
  artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave
  the image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>To begin working, you&rsquo;ll open an existing file set up for the
  letterhead artwork.</p>

  <p>Download and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07StartLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial08StartLetterhd.svg</b></a>.
  This start file has been saved with the rulers showing in inches, custom
  swatches added to the Swatches palette, and blue guidelines for scaling the
  logo and objects on the letterhead.</p>

  <h2>Scaling Objects</h2>
</header>
<p>You scale objects by enlarging or reducing them horizontally (along the x
axis) and vertically (along the y axis) relative to a fixed point of origin
that you designate. If you don&rsquo;t designate an origin, the objects are
scaled from their center points. You&rsquo;ll use three methods to scale the
logo and two objects copied from the logo.</p>

<p>First, you&rsquo;ll use the Transform palette to scale down the logo by
entering new dimensions and designating the point of origin from which the
logo will scale.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Make sure that the <b>Scale stroke width</b> icon and <b>Move gradient
  with object</b> icon are active at the right end of the Commands Bar:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/ScaleStrokeWidthMoveGradients.gif" alt = "Scale stroke
    width and Move gradient with object icons" class = "img-width">
    <figcaption><b>Scale stroke width</b><br>and <b>Move gradient with
    object</b><br>icons active.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, click the logo to select the
  group of objects (type, background, lemon, orange slice, lime slice) that
  make up the logo.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Transfor<u>m</u> to display the Transform
  palette. The Transform palette appears docked on the right side of the
  screen.</p>
  <p>The Transform palette contains options for moving, scaling, rotating,
  skewing, and distorting an object by manipulating the handles of its bounding
  box. You can move an object relative to a point of origin of your choosing or
  absolute position on the artboard, scale an object keeping or not keeping
  aspect ratio, and distort an object by editing its matrix or creating a new
  matrix. For more information than what is presented in this tutorial, choose
  <u>H</u>elp &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; Positioning and Transforming &gt;
  Transformations.</p>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Transform palette.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the <b>Scale</b> tab. Set the unit of measurement to points
  (<b>pt</b>) if it is not set to points already. Set the width to <b>83.75</b>
  points and the height to <b>88.5</b> points. Click on the <b><u>A</u>pply</b>
  button. The logo is now resized to your measurements.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/LogoScaledDown.gif" alt = "Resized logo"
      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Logo scaled down.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>You will now move the logo to the upper left-hand corner of the
  page.</p>
  <p>If the Snap Controls Bar is not visible, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt;
  Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide &gt; Sn<u>a</u>p Controls Bar. A check mark will appear to
  the left of the Snap Controls Bar option when you click on the option and the
  bar will appear.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon (<img src =
  "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt = "Enable snapping icon" width = "26">)
  isn&rsquo;t highlighted, click on it to activate it. Then, click on the
  <b>Snap guides</b> icon (<img src = "images/SnapGuidesIcon.gif" alt =
  "Snap Guides icon" width = "26">) to activate its functioning.</p>

  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> The <b>Enable snapping</b> feature acts as a master
  switch that allows activating all other snapping features under it, including
  the <b>Snap guides</b> function. If the particular snapping feature you want
  to use is not highlighted, check to see whether the <b>Enable
  snapping (%)</b> icon is highlighted. If it&rsquo;s off, turn it on, then
  turn your option on.</p>
	</aside>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the logo with the Select tool (<img src =
  "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) and drag the
  logo to the upper left-hand corner of the artboard where it fits into the
  small square defined by four guide lines.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/LogoMoved.gif" alt = "Logo now moved"
      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Logo moved to upper left-hand corner.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>The upper part of the page should appear similar to the figure below.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/UpperPartOfPage.gif" alt = "Upper part of page"
      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Upper part of page showing ruler.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>Next you&rsquo;ll copy the background object in the logo and scale the new
  object by dragging its bounding box to fit the background of the
  letterhead.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the logo still selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup
  to ungroup the larger group in the logo. See how the smaller subgroups remain
  grouped.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If desired, use the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif"
  alt = "Zoom In/Out tool" width = "26">) to zoom in on the logo.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26">), click away from the logo to deselect it, and
  then click below the word &ldquo;Bath&rdquo; to select the light-blue
  background object in the logo. Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the
  background image. All the objects in the logo become darkened a little bit
  because there is now a copy of the background color, which is actually a
  gradient, on top of all the objects. Now drag the copy the background to the
  bottom left corner of the page, aligning it with the snap guides. You can
  press the arrow keys to nudge it into place.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/BackgroundMoved.gif"
      alt = "Move the background object." class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Move the background object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>Next, you&rsquo;ll make this background object the background for the

  </li>
  <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26">), drag the top right corner of the new
  object&rsquo;s bounding box up to the top right side of the blue letterhead
  guide, to just below the return address.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">

    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the background object still selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt;
  <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click on the <b>L<u>o</u>ck</b> checkbox in the
  <b>Object Properties</b> palette to lock the object. Click away from the
background object to deselect it. Locking the background object makes it easier
to select other objects you&rsquo;ll add to the artwork without accidentally
the background.</p>
<p>You can also lock all artwork above the selected object &ndash; for example,
if you want to edit an object in the background that has objects on top of it
&ndash; or all objects on other layers. In addition, you can use the
<b>Layers</b> palette to lock objects. Once objects are locked, they cannot be
selected or edited. You can quickly lock multiple objects, groups of objects,
and sublayers by locking the parent layer.</p>
<p>The lemon in the logo is comprised of two objects grouped together. Now
you&rsquo;ll copy and move the lemon and place it at the bottom of the
letterhead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the collection of citrus fruits in the lower part of the logo
and choose <u>O</u>bject &lt; <u>U</u>ngroup to separate them into three
distinct objects. If the logo text is also included in the selection, Choose
<u>O</u>bject &lt; <u>U</u>ngroup again to separate the text from the fruit
objects. If the fruits are grouped, ungroup them. Now, select the lemon in the
logo, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to copy it, and move the new lemon to the bottom
right corner of the letterhead guide.</p>

  <h2>Rotating Objects</h2>
</header>
<p>Objects are rotated by turning them around a designed point of rotation. You
can rotate objects by clicking on them twice, first to display their bounding
boxes and handles to allow resizing, and second to display handles to allow
rotation and shearing. When the center of rotation appears after the second
click, you can rotate the object about that point. You can also drag that
center of rotation to any other location you want where it will still act as a
center about which your object will rotate.</p>

<p>You can rotate objects using the Transform palette to set a point of origin
and a rotation angle. You can also rotate objects using the Rotate palette to
set its rotation angle. In the examples below, the middle figure shows a lemon
object rotated about its default center of rotation. In the third example, the
center of rotation has been dragged outside the lemon and a rotation of 30
degrees applied using the <b>Rotate</b> palette in the <b>Transform</b>
palette.</p>
  <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">

  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>

<p>You&rsquo;ll rotate the lemon 30&deg; anticlockwise around its center point
using the <b>Rotate</b> palette.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>With the lemon selected, click on the <b>Rotate</b> tab to bring up
  the <b>Rotate</b> palette.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Type <b>30</b> in the <b>Angle:</b> text field, select the <b>Rotate

  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>S</u>ave.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll create a flower. You will first create the sepals by
distorting the edges of a star. You will then create the petals by rotating
copies of an ellipse, converting them into paths, and then merging them into
one object using the <b>Union</b> option for paths.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Select the Star tool (<img src = "images/StarTool.gif" alt = "Star and
  polygon tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, type <b>5</b> into the
  <b>Corners</b> text box to make a five-pointed star, leave the other settings
  at their default values, and position the pointer in the artwork next to the
  lemon. Drag the tool to draw a five-pointed star that&rsquo;s about the same
  size as the lemon.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/MakeStar.gif" alt = "Make a five-pointed star"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Make a five-pointed star.</figcaption>

  <p>The star is painted with the paint attributes of the last selected object
  (in this case, the lemon).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the star still selected, click on the Lime Green swatch in the

    <figcaption>Change the star&rsquo;s fill color to lime green.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now you&rsquo;ll distort the star by converting it from an object into a

  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to path.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Select the <b>Node</b> tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt =

  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>Now you&rsquo;ll make the flower petals. You&rsquo;ll create a white
  ellipse, move its center of rotation to one end, and use a combination of
  &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the ellipse and the <b>Rotate</b> palette to
  create the remaining four petals to create a five-petaled flower. You&rsquo;ll
  then convert the five ellipses into paths and then use the path <b>Union</b>
  option to merge them into one object.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Make an ellipse and color it white.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the ellipse still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject
  to Path. Click on the ellipse again to bring up the rotate and shear handles.
  The center of rotation should (of course) appear in the center of ellipse.

  <h2>Shearing Objects</h2>
</header>
<p>You will now shear the flower. Shearing an object slants, or skews, the
sides of the object along the axis you specify, keeping opposite sides parallel
and making the object nonsymmetrical.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Marquee select the whole flower and choose Object &gt; Group to group
  them into one object.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the <b>Skew</b> tab in the <b>Transform</b> palette. Enter

  text field at <b>0</b>, and select <b>&deg;</b> (degrees) in the unit of
  measurement field. Click on the <b><u>A</u>pply</b> button. The flower now
  appears to have been turned a little to the left and up.</p>

  <h2>Positioning Objects Precisely</h2>
</header>
<p>You can use guide lines with snapping capabilities and the Transform palette
to move objects to exact coordinates on the x and y axes of the page and to
control the position of objects in relation to a trim edge.</p>

<p>For this portion of the tutorial, you will create a new <b>svg</b> file that
will contain artwork for an envelope. This artwork will be a modified version
of the letterhead logo you just finished.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>N</u>ew.</p
  <p>A new Inkscape window appears with a blank artboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip;</p>
  <p>Using the <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip; dialog window, navigate
  to a convenient location to store the file and save it as
  <b>envelope.svg</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>D</u>ocument Properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Select <b>Page Size:</b> US #10 Envelope 4.1 &times; 9.5 in. and
  uncheck the checkbox for <b>Border:</b> Show border shadow. The artboard drop
  shadow might be a distraction whereas a simple border might define your
  working area more clearly in this case.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the <b>Zoom to fit page in window (5)</b> icon in the
  Commands Bar.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose Exte<u>n</u>sions &gt; Render &gt; Layout &gt; Printing
  marks&hellip; Click on the <b>Marks</b> tab if that tab isn&rsquo;t already
  active. Check the <b>Crop Marks</b> checkbox if it isn&rsquo;t already checked
  and deselect any other checkboxes. Crop marks appear automatically at the
  corners of the envelope-shaped artboard.</p>

    alt = "Envelope with crop marks" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Envelope with crop marks.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Now you will make three guide lines to help in positioning the logo
  and address label on the envelope. To create the top guide line, click on the
  ruler at the top of the work window, left-click to create the guide line and
  drag it down until it is one quarter of an inch down from the top edge of the
  envelope. The line should be aligned at the 4&frac18;-inch mark on the left
  vertical ruler. The line turns blue when you release the left mouse
  button.</p>

    <figcaption>Make the top guide line.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Do the same thing to create a guide line for the bottom part of the
  envelope. Click on the ruler at the top of the work window again and drag the
  new guide line down until it is &frac14; of an inch from the bottom edge of
  the envelope. It will be aligned with the &frac14;-inch mark on the vertical
  ruler at the left side of the work window.</p>
  <p>Create a vertical guide line for the left side of the envelope. Click on
  the ruler on the left side of the work window and drag that new guide line to
  the right until it is &frac14; of an inch from the left edge of the
  envelope.</p>

    <figcaption>Make the remaining guide lines.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>We don&rsquo;t need to make a guide line for the right end of the envelope.
  We will not be putting any artwork there. The envelope artboard is ready to
  receive artwork from the letterhead file.</p>
  <p>For more information on rulers, see <u>H</u>elp &gt; Inkscape Manual. In
  the table of contents, choose <b>1. Quick Start</b> &gt; <b>The Anatomy of

  <li><p>Bring the letterhead artwork file that you were working on earlier.
  You can use the &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; key combination to switch to the
  other active Inkscape window.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26">), draw a marquee around the logo so that all
  the objects in it are selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>C</u>opy to copy the logo to the

  </li>
  <li><p>Press &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; again so you can switch back to the
  envelope Inkscape window.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll move the pasted logo to within &frac14;-inch of the top left
  corner of the envelope by specifying the x and y coordinates in relation to
  the ruler origin. The ruler origin is the point where 0 appears on each
  ruler. The ruler origin in this file begins at the lower left corner of the
  envelope, and the ruler units are in inches.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If the Snapping Toolbar isn&rsquo;t visible, then choose <u>V</u>iew
  &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide &gt; Sn<u>a</u>p Controls Bar. Click on the <b>Enable

  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the logo artwork to the upper left corner of the envelope where
  the guide lines intersect. A tooltip window appears when the upper left corner
  of the logo image is very close to the guide line intersection, signaling
  you of the image&rsquo;s proximity and that snapping to the corner will take
  place.</p>

  <h2>Changing the Perspective</h2>
</header>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll use the Perspective tool to change the perspective of the
orange slice.</p>
<aside>
<header>
  <h3>The Perspective Tool</h3>
</header>
<p>The Perspective tool distorts a path or paths that have been grouped so that
an object&rsquo;s original bounding box is mapped to the edges of a
quadrilateral (square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, etc.) and a
perspective operation is applied to the path.</p>
<p>To use this function,</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>create the envelope box (transformation quadrilateral) that will
  govern how the object will be distorted. Use the Line tool (<img src =
  "images/LineTool.gif" alt = "Line tool icon" width = "26" >), the
  B&eacute;zier pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Bezier pen
  tool icon" width = "26">), or the Rectangle tool (<img src =
  "images/RectangleTool.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool" width = "26">). Make sure
  that the first corner created is the lower left corner of the
  quadrilateral.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Then, convert the envelope box and the object or objects to paths. Use
  the <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path and <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>S</u>troke
  to Path functions.</p>

<p>If you used the Rectangle tool and converted it to a path with
<u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path, you will most likely have to rotate the
quadrilateral 90&deg; anticlockwise to position the first corner node from the
upper left to the lower left corner. This is an idiosyncratic feature of the
Perspective tool we have to work with.</p>

<p>To check for proper orientation, make the Node tool (<img src =
"images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width = "26">) active,
select the quadrilateral if it has been deselected, and press the &lt;Tab&gt;
key. The lower left node of the rectangle should become highlighted, indicating
that the rectangle is oriented corrected. If another node is highlighted
instead, then rotate the rectangle until the highlighted node is the lower left
corner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Perspective tool is idiosyncratic in how it works. Before
transforming your object, both it and the transformation quadrilateral
must be converted into paths. Click on your object and choose <u>P</u>ath &gt;
<u>O</u>bject to Path. Do the same with the quadrilateral.</p>
<p>If your object is a group of objects, convert the individual objects into
individual paths by:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>ungrouping them by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup or by
clicking the <b>Ungroup selected groups</b> icon (<img src =
"images/UngroupIcon.gif" alt = "Ungroup selected groups icon" width = "26">) in
the Commands Bar. Then,</p></li>
  <li><p>with the separate objects still group-selected, convert them into
  separate paths by choosing <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Now regroup these paths with <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup or by
  clicking on the <b>Group selected groups</b> icon (<img src =
  "images/GroupIcon.gif" alt = "Group selected objects icon" width = "26">) in
  the Commands Bar.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Select the grouped paths to be transformed (as a single object now),
  then select the transformation quadrilateral, in this order
  (<u>important!</u>), by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking with the Select tool (<img src
  = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">).</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now and finally, choose <u>E</u>xtensions &gt; Modify Path &gt;
  Perspective.</p>
  <p>If you forget to convert the distortion envelope into a path or any of the
  objects, the Perspective tool will stop and give you a warning message that
  one or both objects weren&rsquo;t converted.</p>
  <p>One way to check whether an object was or wasn&rsquo;t converted is to
  choose the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit Paths by
  Nodes tool" width = "26">). All path nodes show up when this tool is selected.
  You can determine whether any object hasn&rsquo;t been converted by the shape
  and color of its path nodes.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, the Perspective tool doesn&rsquo;t perform the way you want it
  to. To troubleshoot, experiment with different techniques, such as grouping
  all the path objects you want to transform, and then using the Perspective
  tool. If items are already grouped and you still receive a warning message,
  ungroup them and then regroup them again &ndash; this technique works in
  various cases. Outline view (choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>D</u>isplay mode &gt;
  <u>O</u>utline) can be used to identify ghost outlines from objects with
  fills and strokes set to <i>None</i>. Delete them. They can produce
  unexpected results that show up in the transformed object.</p>
  <p><b>Remember:</b> the Perspective tool works <u>only</u> with paths.</p>
</aside>
<aside><p><b>Important:</b> Start drawing the trapezoid from the lower left
corner. Then continue to make edges in a clockwise direction. You are
creating an ordered sequence of corner points that the Inkscape Perspective
function understands and can work with.</p>
</aside>
<ol>
  <li><p>Draw the distortion box.</p>
  <p>To check if the lower left corner is the first made corner, click on the
  trapezoid with the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
  Paths by Nodes tool" width = "26">). Then, press &lt;Tab&gt;. If the first
  corner is highlighted, then the envelope box is correctly oriented.</p>

  <h2>Review Answers</h2>
</header>
<ol>
  <li><p>There are two ways you can resize an object:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can select an object with the Select tool (<img src =
      "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) and drag
      a directional handle. To rescale an object proportionately as you change
      its size, hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key as you drag the directional
      handle.
      </li>
      <li><p>You can resize an object using the <b>Scale</b> option in the
      <b>Transform</b> palette. You can enter its exact height, width, unit of
      measurement (inch, percent, millimeter, centimeter, pixel, pica), and
      resize individual objects separately. The object is resized relative to
      the center of its bounding box.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>The <b>Transform</b> palette allows you to make the following
  transformations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Move:</b> by moving or strategically placing objects in your
      artwork (by specifying the x and y coordinates and the point of
      origin).
      </li>
      <li><b>Scale:</b> by specifying the width and height of selected
      objects, and whether proportionally or not.
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Matrix:</b> by editing the entries in a transformation matrix
      that controls the amount of translation, scaling, rotation, and skewing,
      all in one operation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>You can copy an Inkscape object by:</p>
    <ol type = "a">
      <li>selecting it in the source file with the Select tool <img src =
      "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), and
      then choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>C</u>opy or pressing the hot key
      combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C (<b>C</b> for <b>C</b>opy) to make a duplicate,
      </li>
      <li>making the destination file active by bring up its Inkscape
      window, and
      </li>
      <li><p>choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste or pressing the hot key
      combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the object into its new home.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><p>You can change the perspective of or distort an object by:</p>
    <ol type = "a">
      <li>Converting all objects into paths using the <u>P</u>ath &gt;
      <u>O</u>bject to Path function and converting all strokes to paths using
      the <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>S</u>troke to Path function.
      </li>
      <li>Drawing a 4-sided distortion envelope (a quadrilateral) using the
      Line tool (<img src = "images/LineTool.gif" alt = "Line tool icon" width
      = "26" >), the B&eacute;zier pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif"
      alt = "Bezier pen tool icon" width = "26">), or the Rectangle tool (<img
      src = "images/RectangleTool.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool" width = "26">).
      The first node must be the lower left corner of the quadrilateral.
      </li>
      <li>Selecting both the object or objects to be transformed, and then
      selecting the distortion envelope, and finally
      </li>
      <li><p>Choosing <u>E</u>xtensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Perspective.</p>
