      Effects offer the graphic designer a way to draw hair, fur, and other
      objects that need to appear as a series of wavy curves. By combining
      sub-path stitching, envelope deformation, lattice deformation, and
      sub-path interpolation, the artist can draw areas where the filament look
      of hair, fur, and textiles adds texture, depth, and attractive detail to
      the composition of a piece of artwork.</p>

<section>
  <p>This tutorial comes in two parts. In this part, Tutorial 16, Part A, we
  will focus on the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect to draw hair. We
  will use the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> Live
  Path Effects to refine the overall shapes of areas of hair and create the
  smooth flow of hair that is trained into a ponytail.</p>
  <p>Tutorial 16, Part B, will introduce <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> for more
  flow effects.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following techniques:</p>
  <ul type = "disc">
    <li>draw curves that connect two boundary curves.
    </li>
    <li>refine the shape of a multi-curve object using envelope deformation
    and lattice deformation tools.
    </li>
    <li>Use transparency and color blending to create a sense of hair depth.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to draw hair. You will be working
  with three <b>Live Path Effects</b>. <b>Stitching Sub-paths</b> is a live-path
  function with which you draw a starting line or curve, and an ending line or
  curve. These two boundaries are called <i>sub-paths</i> and help you define
  where a group of cross-lines start and where they end &mdash; you are
  graphically &ldquo;stitching&rdquo; the two sub-paths together.</p>
  <p>A second and related live-path function is the sub-path interpolation live
  path effect. Instead of stitching two sub-paths together, you draw two lines
  or curves that make the sides of an area that you will fill with parallel or
  sub-parallel curves that change in shape from one sub-path on one side to
  the other path on the other side of the space to be filled. We will cover
  sub-path interpolation in the second part of this tutorial.</p>
  <p>For more information about <b>Live Path Effects</b>, go to Help &gt;
  Inkscape Manual &gt; 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs), and click on <b>Stitch
  Sub-Paths</b> or <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16A/Tutorial16A_end.svg"><b>Tutorial16A_end.svg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>File &gt; Open file <b>Tutorial16A_end.svg</b>. This file displays a
    completed illustration of a young woman with a ponytail, facing away from
    the viewer.</p>
    <p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to reduce the view of
    the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen
    as you work. (Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to select and move the artwork
    where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the
    image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
    </li>

  <p><b>Resource:</b> For an illustration of the finished artwork in this
  tutorial, see the top of this page.</p>

        artwork.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Save As&hellip; and save the file as
    <b>Ponytail.svg</b> in a convenient location. This file will be your
    work file.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The art file contains the image of a young woman facing away from the
  camera. The image is on two layers: the bottom layer, which is locked,
  contains the woman as a mannequin figure; the second layer contains hair
  and right ear.</p>

  </figure>
  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>The hair is divided into separate areas. Each area contains hair whose flow
  has its own starting and ending points, degree of curvature, color and
  gradient shading. Each area has its own place in the overall image stack
  to create a sense of hair design as might be done in a salon.</p>

    areas of hair" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Exploded view of the different areas of hair.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The woman&rsquo;s ear is its own grouped object so that it can be placed
  between two bodies of hair to enhance the sense of a 3-D presentation.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Ear.gif" alt = "Image of the mannequin's right ear"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Image of the mannequin&rsquo;s right ear.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The task of this tutorial is to create overlays that you will place
  ontop of the areas of hair to create the look of strands of trained hair
  that follow the curvature of each area. The coloration of underlying areas
  and overlying hair filaments will be different to give the appearance of
  darker hair underneath that is not reached by the light, and lighter-colored,
  variegated hair that is reflecting light. The combination colors and styles of
  coloration produce subtle depth.</p>

    <h2>Drawing Hair Using the <i>Stitch Sub-Paths</i> Live Path Effect</h2>
  </header>
  <p>The <b><i>Stitch Sub-Paths</i> Live Path Effect</b> is a great tool for
  &ldquo;stringing together &rdquo; a starting and an ending boundary path,
  here called <i>sub-paths</i>. This section shows you how to analyze the
  underlying geometry that can guide you in determining how hair should flow
  and then in drawing it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Select the top area of hair with the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ClickingOnTopArea.gif" alt = "Selecting the top area
        of hair" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the top area of hair.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Edit &gt; Duplicate to duplicate the area and then drag the
    duplicated area to a side where you can work on it without the distraction
    of adjacent hair areas.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/DuplicatingTopArea.gif" alt = "Duplicating and moving
      the top area of hair" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Duplicating and moving the top area of hair.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>The hair in this top area ideally appear as if it is coming from over
  the top edge and down into the lower, narrower part of the area that is
  constricted before it enters the ponytail. The figure below provides an idea
  template of how hair filaments might flow from top to bottom.</p>
  <p>You will create a &ldquo;current&rdquo; of hair that flows from over the
  top of the area into the narrow lower portion at the bottom using the
  <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/TrialStitching.gif" alt = "Envisioning stitched paths"
      class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Envisioning stitched paths.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen
  Tool icon" width = "26">), draw two paths (sub-paths), one that follows the
  top curvature of the hair area and ends at a point just above the length of
  &ldquo;straight&rdquo; curve above the bottom, and the other following the
  curve that defines the bottom of the area.</p>
  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> In order for <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> to work properly
  in this particular task, both sub-paths need to be draw in the same direction:
  either right-to-left as shown below, or left-to-right. If the sub-paths are
  drawn but in opposing directions, <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> will make the hair
  paths criss-cross, which is what we don&rsquo;t want.</p>

    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>
    <figure><p>Inkscape now &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the two sub-paths as two separate
    objects. <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> needs to see them as one path in order for
    it to work. The <b>Path Combine</b> function merges them into one item.</p>
    <p>First, group-select the two sub-paths using &lt;Shift&gt;-click. Each
    sub-path is enclosed in its own bounding box.</p>

      <figcaption>Group-selecting sub-paths.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose Path &gt; Combine. The sub-paths are now enclosed in one large
  common bounding box and Inkscape now &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the two sub-paths as
  one compound sub-path.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the <b>Add path effect</b> plus sign icon (<img src =
  "images/AddPathEffectIcon.gif" alt = "Add Path Effect icon" width = "26">).
  The <b>Live Path Effects Selector</b> appears.</p>
  <p>Scroll to the bottom of the <b>Live Path Effects Selector</b> until the
  <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect appears.</p>

  <li><p>Click on the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> icon.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> dialog box appears. The <b>Number of paths</b>
  might be different from that in the figure below, but that is not a
  problem. The lines, however, might have a different stroke color. In the
  figure, we chose a stroke color of yellow and a stroke width of <b>3 px</b>,
  using the <b>Fill and Stroke&hellip;</b>, <b>Stroke paint</b></b> and
  <b>Stroke style</b> dialog boxes. The lines are easily visible and allow for
  easy modification. You will change the color of the lines to a more
  &ldquo;hair-like&rdquo; color shortly. Note that you can have both the
  <b>Fill and Stroke</b> and <b>Path Effects</b> dialogs active at the same
  time.</p>

    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the <b>Fill and Stroke&hellip;</b> <b>Stroke style</b> dialog
  box, change the hair stroke <b>Width</b> to <b>1.000 px</b>. You now have a
  better idea of how to morph the hair pattern into what actually looks like
  hair.</p>

      <figcaption>Changing the hair stroke width to 1.000 pixel.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The shadowy wavy patterns in the hair are calle Moir&eacute; patterns.
    They are frequently visible in folds of cloth, or strands of hair that
    overlay each other, creating eye-catching, and yet attractive, interference
    patterns, such as waves and rays that radiate in or out in unpredictable
    directions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The right side of the hair needs to be reshaped to match with the
  right side of the underlying area. Hair does not usually flow in a purely
  linear way &ndash; it usually has a degree of curvature in its flow. You will
  create a curved flow pattern using the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> Live Path
  Effect.</p>
  <p>Make the <b>Path Effects</b> dialog active and click on the <b>Add path
  effect</b> plus sign icon (<img src = "images/AddPathEffectIcon.gif" alt =

  </li>
  <li><p>The right side of the stitching line object needs the most adjustment
  of the four sides. You can accomplish this using the <b>Edit on-canvas</b>
  tool for the <b>Right bend path</b> (<img src = "images/BendPathToolIcon.gif"

    <li><p>Inkscape allows you to randomly change the spacing between adjacent
    stitch lines. You will apply this function to create uneven spacing between
    lines.<p>
    <p>Make the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> dialog box active. Enter <b>7</b> into
    the <b>Start spacing variance</b> and <b>End spacing variance</b> text

    "images/RandomNumberGeneratorIcon.gif" alt = "Random number generator icon"
    width = "26">) for each option and continue clicking until you get a
    spacing style that you like.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> each time you click a <b>Random number generator</b> icon,
    Inkscape creates a new sequence of random numbers that you can use in turn
    in creating unevenness in how far stitch paths are positioned from each
    other. This feature is particularly useful in producing the trained, and yet
    subtley uneven spacing between hair strands in this project. Larger values
    for a random number generator produce larger variations in random values.
    They can result in larger spacings between adjacent lines. A value of
    <b>0</b> creates regular spacing, that is, the <b>Random number
    generator</b> is turned off.</p>
    <p>Experiment with different values for a random number generator and see
    what you get. The more you use it, the more you develop your intuition for
    how to use it.</p>

  be using the same tools and techniques as you draw hair that makes up the knot

  <b>Opacity</b> tool to use transparency as a way to shade the upper layer of
  hair differently from the color texture underneath.</p>

  <p>You have learned how to draw and texture hair using the <b>Stitch
  Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b>
  Live Path Effects. Color blending and transparency refine your sense of how
  to create three-dimensionality using color to give subtle, and yet believable
  depth to your artwork. You will finish the artwork of this tutorial in
  Tutorial 16, Part B, where you will be introduced to the <b>Sub-Path
  Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect which can make filling certain shapes with
  lines easier than with <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and
    <b>Lattice Deformation</b> tools are related in your workflow in that you
    first draw the hair using <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>. To make the hair strands
    curved, you need to modify their original straight lengths using either
    <b>Envelope Deformation</b> or <b>Lattice Deformation</b>. <b>Envelope
    Deformation</b> can be used for simple shapes and <b>Lattice Deformation</b>
    should be used for shapes having complex geometries.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Envelope Deformation</b> affects the overall shape of an object
    using sides of a bounding box envelope. The top, left, right, and bottom
    sides are separable tools whereby you can change the shape of each
    side&rsquo;s line segment and end nodes without affecting the other
    sides.</p>
    <p><b>Lattice Deformation</b> works via a lattice grid whereby you can
    change the curvature and location of points both on the edges and inside a
    shape, producing complex modifications that <b>Envelope Deformation</b>
    can&rsquo;t do.</p>
    </li>
