  <p>This particular tutorial comes in three-parts &ndash; there is so
  much material on mesh gradients to cover. Much of what is presented here is
  in pictures that take up a lot of space. Their purpose is take make the
  learning process easier than if everything was just plain text. As you go
  through this tutorial and the artwork develops as you scroll down, the
  imagery that you create might look similar enough to what you see here.
  Absolute precision is not important &mdash; learning the methods and getting
  the feel of working and playing with them is.</p>
  <p>Make the <b>Undo</b> function your friend. If at first you don&rsquo;t
  succeed, undo and try, try again! If you feel that your brain is full, take a
  break! I do. And, have fun!</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a mesh grid.</li>
    <li>Apply colors to a mesh.</li>
    <li>Edit a mesh for a variety of effects.</li>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll convert the shapes of two butterflies into
  meshes, paint them, and manipulate the color blending. Before you begin, you
  will open the finished art file for the tutorial to see what you&rsquo;ll
  create.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/Tutorial13Aend.svg"><b>Tutorial13Aend.svg</b></a> and store
    it in a convenient location on your computer. Note that the file image might
    look like one wing is missing when viewing it in its Internet source
    location. There is a wing section &mdash; you might just be experiencing an
    incompatibility between the viewing software in your browser and the flavor
    of <b>svg</b> (scalable vector graphics) that Inkscape uses. Choose File
    &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial13_end.svg</b> file. The missing wing
    should appear (along with everything else in the file).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the
    finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on your

    <h2>Introduction to the Mesh Tool</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Creating gradients using the Mesh tool is both a science and an art. The
  science aspect involves creating a mesh grid with which you will define the
  geometry of the gradient borders and where different colors are to be
  positioned. The art aspect involves your sense and sensibility of
  manipulating the mesh grid so the colors look the way you want them in terms
  of how they blend amongst each other to match what your imagination has
  produced. The art of mesh gradients comes with experimenting, undoing and
  redoing mistakes, and just playing with the possibilities that appear on
  your mental computer screen.</p>
  <p>First, you&rsquo;ll paint a color on one of the tail wings on a butterfly.
  You&rsquo;ll start out with a simple mesh to get a basic feel for the Mesh
  tool, and then you&rsquo;ll paint the other tail wing with the same
  colors.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Make a duplicate of the top butterfly&rsquo;s lower left wing and
    move it to a side of the artboard to work on.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/CopyLowerRightWing.gif" alt = "Making a copy of the
        butterfly's lower left wing" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Making a copy of the butterfly&rsquo;s lower left
        wing.<figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Rotate the wind so that the tip of its tail is at the midpoint of
    the top line segment of the bounding box. This orientation will make it a
    little easier to work with the Mesh grid.</p>
    <p>Doing a preliminary step like rotating an object so its main axes of
    symmetry line up with the x-axis and y-axis of the work window is a wise
    thing to do. It makes grid manipulation easier and can give you clearer
    insight into how you want to work with your coloration.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/RotateLowerRightWing.gif" alt = "Rotating the
        butterfly's lower left wing" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Rotating the butterfly&rsquo;s lower left wing.<figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the butterfly wing still selected (reselect if it isn&rsquo;t),
    click on the <b>Create and edit meshes</b> tool (<img src =
    "images/CreateMeshToolIcon.gif" alt = "Create and edit meshes tool icon"
    width = "26">) in the toolbox. The Select tool cursor (<img src =
    "images/SelectionToolCursor.gif" alt = "Selection tool cursor" width =
    "26">) turns into the <b>Mesh tool</b> cursor (<img src =
    "images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt = "Mesh tool cursor" width = "26">).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Double-click on the edge of the wing (<u>not</u> inside the wing)
    with the Mesh tool cursor to create the mesh grid.</p>
      <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
        <img src = "images/MeshCursorOnEdgeOfObject.gif" alt = "Mesh toolbox

      </figure>
    </li>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <li><p>Notice that grid points in the selected object are either solid
    diamonds or open circles. Also, the object has a mesh point at the
    intersection of the two inside mesh lines, and two open circles between
    each pair of mesh points. Mesh points define where the center of an area
    of color is located.</p>
    <p>The open circles are mesh handles that allow you to change the shape
    of an area of color. By moving the circles, you move the boundaries
    of an area of color to suit your preferences.</p>
    <p>Each mesh point has at least two mesh handles associated with it. Mesh
    points at the corners of the grid have two handles associated with them,
    mesh points on the grid sides but not on the corners have three handles
    associated with them, and mesh points inside the grid body have four mesh
    handles.</p>

    <h2>Moving Mesh Points and Mesh Handles</h2>
  </header>
  <h4>Moving a Single Mesh Point</h4>
  <p>When you move a mesh point, you move the center of an area of color
  associated with that center. The mesh handles associated with that mesh point
  also move with that mesh point, keeping the same distance and orientation. As
  a result, you move an entire area of color while maintaining its original
  shape, size and orientation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>With the Mesh tool cursor (<img src = "images/MeshToolCursor.gif"
    alt = "Mesh tool cursor" width = "26">) active, click on the middle mesh
    point.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ClickOnCenterMeshPoint.gif" alt = "Clicking on the
        center mesh point" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Clicking on the center mesh point.<figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The four mesh handles closest to the selected mesh point turn into
      arrows, all pointing toward the mesh point. This feature is excellent
      for indicating which mesh point they&rsquo;re associated with. The arrows
      have a black stroke and white fill so they will always be visible, no
      matter what the underlying color is. The center mesh point is colored
      blue, indicating that it is selected.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click-drag the center mesh point to the center of the wing. It does
    not have to be moved to the exact center. See how the white area underneath
    the mesh point moves with the mesh point. Also note how the four mesh
    handles, now arrows, move with the mesh point, maintaining their original
    distance and orientation. Lastly, the central grid lines are now curved,
    especially the horizontal grid line, to maintain connection with the center
    mesh point.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MoveCenterMeshPoint.gif" alt = "Moving the center
        mesh point" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving the center mesh point.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Moving Multiple Mesh Points</h4>
  <p>By &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on two or more mesh points with Mesh tool cursor
  (<img src = "images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt = "Mesh tool cursor" width =
  "26">), you can group-select them as if you were using the Select tool
  (<img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon"
  width = "26">) and moving them as a group.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z to undo the move until you get to where you were
    at Step 1 in the previous section with the middle mesh line straight across
    (you might have to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z more than once).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now, &lt;Shift&gt;-click the three mesh points on the middle mesh
    line to group-select them. All three mesh points turn blue to indicate that
    they are selected.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ShiftClickingMiddleGridLine.gif" alt =
        "Shift-clicking the middle grid line mesh points" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Shift-clicking the middle grid line mesh
        points.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on any of the three blue mesh points with Mesh tool cursor
    (<img src = "images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt = "Mesh tool cursor" width =
    "26">) and drag the middle mesh line straight down until it is a quarter of
    the way up from the bottommost mesh point.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/MoveMiddleGridLineDown.gif" alt =
      "Moving the middle grid line down" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Moving the middle grid line down.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Note that the three mesh handles associated with the rightmost mesh
    point on the middle mesh line are arrows, indicating that the rightmost
    mesh point was the last one selected and that it is still selected and
    active.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the center mesh point. It will stay selected (it remains
    blue). However, the two side mesh points will deselect. Now, click-drag the
    center mesh point right to the middle of the wing shape (you don&rsquo;t
    have to be precise).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectCenterPointDeselectSidePoints.gif" alt =
        "Selecting the center mesh point and deselecting the side mesh points"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the center mesh point,<br>deselecting the side
        mesh points,<br>and moving the center mesh point<br>to the middle of the
        wing shape.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Note how the white patch and mesh handles follow the mesh point.</p>
    </li>
    <aside>
      <p><b>Tip:</b> If you have a lot of mesh points that need to be moved,
      you might find that repositioned mesh handles can produce a confusing
      mess. One way to reduce the confusion and frustration that can ensue
      involves moving the mesh handles for each mesh point closer in to the
      point. So, when you move this and that point, the mesh handles stay in
      close proximity to the mesh point, allowing you to keep track of them
      more easily. Once the mesh points are in place, you can then pull the
      handles away from their associated mesh point to restretch the color area
      into its proper geometry. It&rsquo;s almost like working with Silly
      Putty (if anybody remembers Silly Putty).</p>
      <p>Below are three examples of how you can determine which mesh handles
      go to which mesh points, using the bottommost mesh points and handles,
      and the fact that the middle mesh line had been lowered.</p>
        <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
          <img src = "images/BottomLeftMeshPointSelected.gif" alt = "Bottom
          left mesh point selected and associated mesh handles activated"
          class = "img-fluid">
          <figcaption>Bottom left mesh point selected and<br>associated mesh
          handles activated.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
          <img src = "images/BottomCenterMeshPointSelected.gif" alt = "Bottom
          center mesh point selected and associated mesh handles activated"
          class = "img-fluid">
          <figcaption>Bottom center mesh point selected and<br>associated mesh
          handles activated.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src = "images/BottomRightMeshPointSelected.gif" alt = "Bottom
          right mesh point selected and associated mesh handles activated"
          class = "img-fluid">
          <figcaption>Bottom right mesh point selected and<br>associated mesh
          handles activated.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </aside>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <li><p>The wind needs to have a black border and a deep purple center.
    Making the black border is more challenging than making the purple center.
    Also, by keeping the wing&rsquo; center white, it will be easy to shape
    the black border by virtue of stronger color contrast, compared to working
    with a deep or dark purple center and, thus, less contrast between
    colors.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Start on the black border by moving the mesh handles associated with
    the three bottom mesh points closer to their respective points.</p>
    <p>Click on the bottom center mesh point. Its associated mesh handles turn
    into arrows. Note that the bottom mesh points have their upper mesh
    handles located above the mesh handles associated with the mesh points on
    the middle mesh line. You can verify this upside-down orientation by
    clicking on a mesh point on the middle mesh line and then clicking on a
    bottom mesh point. This orientation happened when you moved the middle mesh
    line down from its original central position in Step 3 above. The mesh
    handles maintained their original relationship to their mesh points.</p>
    <p>Move the mesh handles closer in for each mesh point on the bottom line.
    Note that an arrow fill turns red when the mesh tool cursor hovers over
    it.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left;" class = "ml-5 mr-5">
      <img src = "images/MeshHandlesCloserToMeshPoint.gif" alt = "Mesh handles
      moved closer in to mesh point."

      <figcaption>Mesh handles moved closer in to mesh point.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Bottom line mesh points now have handles moved in
      closer.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    <p>The right-hand mesh handle is the last one moved in the first figure.
    Its color fill is red because the mesh tool cursor is still hovering over
    it.</p>
    <p>The grey color in the lower right corner of the figure has become
    subtley darker. The two mesh handles that belong to the bottom right mesh
    point have been moved away from their original area of influence where
    they help define a patch of white color. That white color patch still exists
    but it is now more restricted to the very near neighborhood of its mesh
    point, which is off the wing shape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the bottom mesh points individually up to the wing figure so
    that they bring the whole bottom mesh line up to closely approximate the
    geometry of the that part of the wing. Note how the coloration changes in
    response to the new placement of the mesh points with their close-in mesh
    handles. Also, when a segment of the mesh line moves to inside the figure,
    it creates a white-filled patch defined by the outer border of the figure
    itself and the inner mesh line. You will correct this discrepancy in
    painting shortly.</p>

    <li><p>You will now paint the bottom edge of the wing black.</p>
    <p>With the Mesh tool cursor (<img src = "images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt =

    Click drag the right-hand mesh handle to verify that the curvature of the
    curve segment between the center and right-hand points aligns with the curve
    of the wing shape. It is alright if the grid curve is outside of the wing a
    little bit. See how the handle arrow points along the curve, causing the
    curve of the mesh grid to follow the curve of the wing at the point. You
    will notice if the grid curve is inside the wing  &ndash; because of the odd
    area of white.</p>
    <p>With the bottom center mesh point still selected, pull down the left-hand
    handle to see the grid curve to the left. There is no difference in the grid
    curvature when you pull the handle down, so release the mouse key and press

    position.</p>

    <li><p>Now you&rsquo;ll change the curvature of the left, center, and right

    By creating a color fill to the tail this way, you will have better control
    over how colors blend from one to another inside the mesh grid, and thus,
    inside the wing.</p>
    <p>First, magnify the top area of the mesh grid so you&rsquo; see better
    what you&rsquo;ll be doing.</p>
    <p>Then, move all the mesh handles inward toward their respective mesh
    points. You&rsquo;ll be moving mesh points, so you&rsquo;ll need to keep
    mesh handles together in distinct and recognizable groups to keep them
    manageable.</p>

    Click-drag the lower mesh handle of the right mesh point down and to the

    changes as you approach the upper mesh point. Once you see that the mesh
    line has moved away from the wing tail so the tip appears in its entirety,
    you can stop moving the mesh handle. The mesh line now conforms much better
    to the geometry of the tail tip, and the tip is all black.</p>

    <li><p>Your artwork might not look exactly like the figure below. That is
    just fine. It is important that you have a feeling for how to create and
    edit grid meshes using mesh points and mesh handles.</p>

  <p>You will use your artwork in the next tutorial, where you will learn other
  gradient mesh techniques that further enhance your ability to create imagery
  that falls pleasantly on the eyes.</p>
  <p>Explore using different gradient colors, moving mesh points and handles
  around to alter the shapes of color patches. If you don&rsquo;t like what you
  just did, use &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or the Undo tool (<img src =
  "images/UndoIcon.gif" alt = "Undo icon" width = "26">) to undo your mistake
  so you can start over.</p>

    <li><p>You click on the <b>Create and edit meshes</b> tool (<img src =
    "images/CreateMeshToolIcon.gif" alt = "Create and edit meshes tool icon"
    width = "26">) in the toolbox.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>A gradient mesh point acts a center point for the creation of a
    patch of color. A gradient mesh handle allows you to stretch, contract, and
    change the direction into which a color patch extends.</p>
