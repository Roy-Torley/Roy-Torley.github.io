      tool helps you in highlighting the curvature of rounded objects, such as
      globes and vases, in ways that create the sense of a single directed
      light source. The Swirl tool helps in creating a texture on a curved
      surface, further enhancing a 3-D effect.</p>
      </div>

<section>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following:</p>
  <ul type = "disc">
    <li>Unevenly swirl a two-dimensional texture.
    </li>
    <li>Clip a background texture to create an illusion of a textured spherical
    surface.
    </li>
    <li>Add a radial gradient to a background image to produce a curved
    reflection of a distant light source.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tutorial is the second of two parts in which you create 3-D objects
  for a poster. You have already created a short cylindrical canister with a
  lid, linear gradient on the side, and a decorative band that follows the
  middle line of the cylindrical body.</p>
  <p>In this part, you will draw lemon soap globes that will have surface
  texturing and radial gradients that suggest a diffuse reflection of light
  from a nearby source of illumination. You will also draw a vase that is
  made up of separate objects, merge them into one object, and then add
  gradients to the result to produce lighting, shadowing, and three-dimensional
  solidity.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15B/Tutorial15B_end.svg"><b>Tutorial15B_end.svg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>File &gt; Open file <b>Tutorial15B_end.svg</b>. This file displays a
    completed illustration of a soap can, soap globes, and a vase.</p>
    <p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to reduce the view of
    the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen
    as you work. (Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">) to select and move the artwork
    where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the
    image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
    </li>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Stylized lemon skin.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Import the lemon skin image into your <b>Lemon.svg</b> work file by
    choosing File &gt; Open, selecting file <b>StylizedLemonSkin.svg</b>, and
    opening it.</p>
    <li><p>Select the image of the lemon skin and choose Edit &gt; Copy to copy
    it to the clipboard.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Switch to the <b>Lemon.svg</b> Inkscape window, place the cursor
    to a side of the canister artwork and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the
    lemon skin image at that location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will create a swirl effect with the lemon skin image. The
    swirling motion will contribute to the three-dimensionality of the soap
    globes, enhanced further by applying a radial gradient.</p>
    <p>With the lemon skin image, choose Extensions &gt; Raster &gt;
    Swirl&hellip;. When the <b>Swirl</b> dialog box appears, set the
    <b>Degrees</b> value to <b>100</b>. Check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox
    so you will see the result before you actually apply the value.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>Apply</b> button to apply the swirl value, then click on
    the <b>Close</b> button to dismiss the dialog box.</p>
    <p>If you would like more swirl, then press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z to undo the swirl
    action, choose Extensions &gt; Raster &gt; Swirl&hellip; again, and enter
    another value into the <b>Degrees</b> text box.</p>
      <figure>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Swirling the lemon skin.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now &ldquo;squash&rdquo; the lemon skin image.</p>
    <p>Choose Object &gt; Transform&hellip;, and click on the <b>Scale</b>
    tab. Set the <b>Height</b> to <b>50.000 %</b>. Keep the <b>Width</b> at
    <b>100.000 %</b>.</p>
    <p>The swirl effect appears to be angled, which is what you want.
    It&rsquo;s as if you are looking at it from an angle, instead of from
    straight up from the swirl center.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Height50Percent.gif" alt = "Rescaling the lemon skin
        image to 50 percent height" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Rescaling the lemon skin image to 50 percent
        height.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now create a clipping mask for a soap globe.</p>
    <p>Select the <b>Ellipse</b> tool (<img src = "images/EllipseToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Ellipse tool icon" width = "26">) in the toolbox and draw an ellipse
    over the swirl. Set the ellipse&rsquo;s stroke to black, stroke thickness
    to 1 pixel, and fill color to <b>none</b>. With a thin black stroke and no
    color fill, you can easily position the ellipse clipping mask where you
    need it with precision.</p>
    <p>Place the ellipse on the swirl so that the center of the swirl occupies
    the top right portion of the ellipse. The effect of a slightly off-center
    swirl heightens the sense of the globe being a three-dimensional object.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/EllipseClippingMask.gif" alt = "Drawing the ellipse
        clipping mask" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Drawing the ellipse clipping mask.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the ellipse by clicking on its border. (You can&rsquo;t select
    it by clicking inside &mdash; there is no color fill and thus nothing to
    select.). &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the background swirl to group-select it.
    Choose Object &gt; Clip &gt; Set. The swirl outside the ellipse is hidden;
    the portion inside the ellipse remains. Note how the squashed swirl imparts
    a 3-D feel to the artwork, even a sense of motion, which is nice and catches
    the eye.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Clipped.gif" alt = "Clipping the lemon skin image"

    </li>
    <li><p>With the globe given a good surface texture and properly clipped,
    it is now time to apply a gradient to simulate lighting and shadowing to
    simulate depth. The lighting and shadow effect will be in the form of an
    overlay.</p>
    <p>With the <b>Ellipse</b> tool (<img src = "images/EllipseToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Ellipse tool icon" width = "26">), draw another ellipse with a thin
    black stroke and no fill, just like the last one you drew the coincides
    exactly with the elliptical soap globe. This second ellipse will be the
    overlay.</p>

    <li><p>Start making the radial gradient by choosing Object &gt; Fill and
    Stroke&hellip;, and selecting the <b>Radial Gradient</b> tab in the <b>Fill
    and Stroke</b> dialog box. A black-to-white default radial gradient now
    fills the ellipse. (The gradient swatches below the default swatch are
    from previous experiments of my own.)</p>

    <li><p>Select the <b>Create and edit gradients</b> tool (<img src =
    "images/EditGradientsIcon.gif" alt = "Create and edit gradients tool icon"
    width = "26">) in the toolbox. The <b>Edit gradient</b> tool appears

    <li>With the central radial gradient node still selected, click-drag the
    node to the upper right portion of the ellipse so it is more-or-less

    <li><p>The two end nodes on the each gradient direction line control the
    outer color that the central color grades to. They will control the shadow
    in the lower section of the ellipse.</p>
    <p>Click-drag one of the end nodes around until they are both situated
    in the lower part of the ellipse. Their placement doesn&rsquo;t have to be
    exact. One, the other, or both nodes can even be extended out beyond the
    edge of the ellipse. You will see the dark part of the radial gradient
    change as you adjust the direction and length of the gradient lines.
    Adjust as you see fit.</p>

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The shadow effect isn&rsquo;t strong. Adding a gradient stop in
    the middle of the gradient lines can help you in controlling the darkness
    and placement of the shadow with finer control.</p>
    <p>Double-click in the middle of one of the gradient lines with the <b>Edit
    gradient</b> cursor (<img src = "images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt =
    "Edit gradient cursor" width = "26">). An extra gradient stop appears on
    both lines as a blue diamond, meaning that they are active and waiting to
    receive a new color and/or to be moved.</p>

    <li><p>Resize the gradient direction lines, rotate them, and click on one
    or the other end node to change its color to a lighter or darker shadow
    color. Also adjust the transparency of the shadow. Try a 50 percent opacity,
    less, or more, until you are satisfied with what you see.</p>

    <li><p>If you separate the soap globe and the lighting-shadow overlay,
    you can see how the upper right region of the overlay can give the
    impression that a light is shining upon it from an angle, while underneath,
    the shadow suggests that the object is solid and opaque, not permitting
    light to reach the bottom. For round objects, this technique is effective
    at producing the illusion of a three-dimensional round object.</p>
    <p>A simple real-world example is to take an egg, put it on a table, and
    see how light interacts with it. Look at it from different angles, place
    the egg at different distances from any source of illumination, and see how
    the interplay of light and shadow change in complementary ways to maintain
    the sense of three-dimensionality. It is your job to learn how to replicate
    what you observe and use it in your own sense of design.</p>

    <h2>Using the Path Union Function and Radial Gradients to Create a Vase</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Vases are objects of revolution. The concept comes from geometry where you
  take a line or curve and rotate it around an axis of rotation. Cylinders,
  spheres, bowls, cones, and vases are example of lines or curves and rotated
  around an axis. You have already learned how to make a cylinder and globes,
  and give them a three-dimensional appearance.</p>
  <p>The vase in this tutorial is a composite shape, made of a circle that is
  flattened at one end, a neck made of two joined curves, and an open top
  created from an ellipse.</p>
  <p>Although the vase is simple in geometry, you will give it the close
  attention that a skilled ceramicist would give in creating in piece of fine
  porcelain by hand.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Select the <b>Ellipse</b> tool (<img src =
    "images/EllipseToolIcon.gif" alt = "Ellipse tool icon" width = "26">) in
    the toolbox.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Draw a circle using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag. Give it a thin black stroke
    and no (<b>none</b>) color fill.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will flatten the bottom of the circle to impart the look that it
    is the bottom of the vase that sits on a flat surface.</p>
    <p>Start by choosing Path &gt; Object to Path. You will have great freedom
    to deforming one small part of the circle while leaving the rest of the
    circumference unaffected. Four nodes appear on the four quadrants of the
    circle.</p>

    <h2>Making a Placemat Using a Pattern Fill</h2>
  </header>
  <p>The last item to draw is a placemat. You will draw a trapezoid to represent
  a square mat that recedes into the distance and fill it with lines that also
  recede within the sides.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>With the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt = "Pen
    tool icon" width = "26">), draw a trapezoid. Note: drawing the horizontal
    sides is easy when you draw pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key &mdash; the
    &lt;Ctrl&gt; key maintains the intended horizontal direction even if the
    cursor wanders off the line.</p>
      <figure>

    </li>
    <li>With the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node
    tool icon" width = "26">), adjust the placement of any nodes so that your
    placemat enjoys a symmetrical geometry.</p>
      <figure>

    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =

    trapezoid with a pattern. The nodes disappear and the bounding box now has
    direction handles.</p>

    Stroke&hellip;, <b>Fill</b> tab, the Pattern button (<img src = "
    images/PatternButton.gif" alt = "Pattern button" width = "26">).</p>
    <p>If the <b>Pattern fill</b> does not default to <b>Stripes 1:1</b>, then
    select <b>Stripes 1:1</b> from the dropdown list of patterns. The trapezoid
    is now filled with alternating black and transparent vertical bars.</p>

    appear on the corners of the trapezoid and the <b>Pattern</b> tool appears
    at the upper left corner of the artboard (in the orange ellipse).</p>

    the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, rotate the circle (now red because it is active)
    around the <b>&times;</b> symbol until it is directly below the
    <b>&times;</b>. Note that pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key causes the circle
    symbol &cir; to rotate in 15 degree increments. As you rotate the circle
    symbol &cir;, the vertical bars change their orientation until they are
    horizontal.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>Reduce the thickness of the now horizontal bars by dragging the
    square symbol <b>&square;</b> upwards until you achieve a bar thickness
    that you like. The square turns red as you drag it, indicating that it is
    active. The circle symbol <b>&cir;</b> moves with the square, yet keeping
    its orientation to the <b>&times;</b> symbol. The closer the circle is to
    the <b>&times;</b> symbol, the thinner the bars become.</p>

<p>You have now completed the Inkscape tutorial that focuses on creating the
appearance of three-dimensionality in your artwork. Gradients can be an
essential feature in simulating depth, distance, and the sense that some objects
sit before, after, or next to others.</p>
<p>Experiment with different lighting and shadowing colors, different degrees
of contrast, and consider adding other sources of illumination placed in
different directions. Base your experiments on what you see in reality, and
then let your imagination take over. Let Inkscape be your playground of the
imagination!</p>

    <h2>Review Questions</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li>How can you determine whether a linear gradient or radial gradient is
    better for creating creating lighting and shadowing on an object?
    </li>
    <li>How can you make a rim of a bowl, cup, or vase look solid and
    three-dimensional?
    </li>
    <li>When an object is made up of several parts that touch, what can you
    do to create smooth lighting and shadowing across the entire object? What
    can you do if parts do not touch?
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>A basic rule-of-thumb is to take a real-world object similar to what
    you want to paint and place it under the type of illumination you intend to
    duplicate. Critically observe how light is distributed across the surface
    or surfaces, and where and how shadowing appears. Then, make your
    determination.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To give the appearance of solidity to a rim of anything having a
    top or opening, select the object that defines the rim and increase the
    width of the stroke using the <b>Width</b> feature in the <b>Stroke
    style</b> dialog box. Adding a linear or radial gradient to the stroke via
    the <b>Stroke paint</b> dialog box allows you to be creative with the
    lighting of the rim to enhance the 3-D effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If the object you want to paint consists of parts that can be joined
    smoothly, like a vase, cup, or bowl, join them by first group-selecting
    them and then by choosing Path &gt; Union to unite them into one path.
    Inkscape&rsquo;s gradient functions will see that path as one entity that
    they can fill as you see fit.</p>
    <p>If parts do not touch, then treat each separate part individually by
    giving them their own gradients. If they are illuminated by the same light
    source, make sure that the direction of illumination and shadowing are
    similar on all the objects to maintain consistency in the play of light.</p>
