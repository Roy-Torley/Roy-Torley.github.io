  <p>This particular tutorial is the third of a three-part chapter. Yes, the end
  is in sight!</p>
  <p>Be comfortable using the <b>Undo</b> function and the <b>Zoom</b> function.
  The <b>Undo</b> function makes it very easy to retrace your steps if something
  doesn&rsquo;t look the way it should. The <b>Zoom</b> function allows for
  deep, up-close viewing of fine-detail work &ndash; it&rsquo;s a great
  magnifying glass when needed, and a great telescope when also needed.</p>
  <p>Do take breaks! Time passes with amazing speed when you get into the
  flow.</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply transparency to a gradient mesh.</li>
    <li>Copy artwork from one Inkscape file to another.
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <header>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll continue working the art file that you began
  in the previous tutorial.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape if you exited it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13C/Tutorial13C_end.svg"><b>Tutorial13C_end.svg</b></a> and store
    it in a convenient location on your computer. Note that the file image might
    look like there are wing parts missing when viewing it in its Internet
    source location. There are wing parts &mdash; you might just be
    experiencing an incompatibility between the viewing software in your
    browser and the flavor of <b>svg</b> (scalable vector graphics) that
    Inkscape uses. Choose File &gt; Open, and open the
    <b>Tutorial13C_end.svg</b> file. The missing wing parts should appear
    (along with everything else in the file).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/AllDone.gif" alt = "Finished tutorial artwork"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Finished tutorial art file.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the
    finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on your
    screen as you work. If you don&rsquo;t want to leave the image open,
    choose File &gt; Close.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To begin working, File &gt; Open file <b>Butterfly.svg</b>, which
    you worked on in Tutorial 13A and 13B. If, however, you did not create
    <b>Butterfly.svg</b>, then download file <a href =
     "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13C/Tutorial13C_start.svg"><b>Tutorial13C_start.svg</b></a> and store
    it in a convenient location on your computer. Choose File &gt; Open to open
    it.</p>

    <h2>Adding Transparency to a Gradient Mesh</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Adding transparency to a gradient mesh is very easy to do. In this section,
  you will simulate the tinted see-through quality of a dragonfly&rsquo;s
  membrane wing.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>To start, magnify the dragonfly. Select a wing with the Select tool (
    <img src = "images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt = "Selection tool icon" width
    = "26">) (we selected the lower left wing) and duplicate it using
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly1.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Magnifying the dragonfly and selecting a wing and
        duplicating it.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the duplicated wing to the left and rotate it so it is oriented
    horizontally in preparation for makiing a gradient mesh.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly2.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving and rotating the duplicated wing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the wing still selected, click on the <b>Create and edit
    meshes</b> icon in the toolbox (<img src = "images/CreateMeshToolIcon.gif"
    alt = "Create and edit mesh tool icon" width = "26">). In the <b>Mesh Tool
    Controls Bar</b> that appears, set <b>Rows = 3</b>, <b>Columns =
    2</b>, and <b>Smoothing = Bicubic</b>.</p>
    <p>Choose Objects &gt; Fill and Stroke&hellip;, click on the <b>Fill</b>
    tab, and click on the <b>Mesh gradient</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/MeshGradientIcon.gif" alt = "Mesh gradient icon" width = "26">).
    The dragonfly wing is now enclosed by a 3 row &times; 2 column gradient
    mesh.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly3.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>3 &times; 2 gradient mesh.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will shortly move mesh points so they conform more to the overall
    shape of the wing.</p>
    <p>Move all the mesh handles in toward their respective mesh points.<p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly4.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving mesh handles in toward their respective mesh
        points.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now move all the edge mesh points in so they just touch or lie just
    outside the shape of the wing. Adjust mesh handles so external mesh lines
    follow the curvature of the dragonfly wing outline without entering the
    shape &ndash; you&rsquo;ll cut off part of the wing, otherwise.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly5.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving mesh points and adjusting mesh handles so the mesh
        conforms to the shape of the wing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Group-select or singly select all mesh points in preparation for
    coloring the wing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly6.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting mesh points.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Color all the mesh points with the original deep purple of the wing.
    Use the Dropper tool (<img src = "images/DropperToolIcon.gif" alt = "Dropper
    tool icon" width = "26">) to sample the color of the original wing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly7.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Coloring all mesh points deep purple.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now add a highlight to the middle of the dragonfly wing.
    Group-select the two inner mesh points with the <b>Mesh tool</b>
    cursor (<img src = "images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt = "Mesh tool cursor"
    width = "26">).</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Selecting the inner two mesh points.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the <b>HSL</b> button in the <b>Fill</b> panel and set the
    lightness value <b>L = 100</b>.

        <figcaption>Creating a highlight.</figcaption>

    </li>
    <li><p>You will now make the wing transparent. Set the opacity of the wing
    to <b>29</b> percent.</p>
    <p>Remember that opacity is just the opposite of tranparency. If an object
    is less opaque, then it is more transparent.</b>

        <figcaption>Setting the wing opacity to 29%.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Here is a neat technique for replacing the original dragonfly wing with
    the new transparent version.</p>
    <p>Select the original wing. Set its border to black to by
    &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the black swatch in the Color palette at the
    bottom of the work window.</p>
    <p>Make the fill absolutely transparent by clicking on the <b>none</b>
    swatch next to the black swatch.</p>
    <p>Move the tranparent wing closer to the original wing and rotate it so
    it has roughly the same orientation as the original.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly11.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Original wing with no color fill and black outline.
        The tranparent wing is moved close for easy orientation.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move and fine-rotate the new wing so it fits precisely into the
    black outline.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Dragonfly12.gif" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Precision emplacement of the new wing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the new wing object still selected, click on the <b>Lower
    selection one step</b> icon (<img src = "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif"
    alt = "Lower selection one step icon" width = "26">) once or twice to place
    it underneath the black outline.</p>
    <p>Press the &lt;Esc&gt; key to deselect the wing. Then, select the black
    edge of the wing and press the &lt;Del&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; key to delete
    it. If you accidentally delete the transparent wing instead, then press
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z to undo the mistake and press the <b>Lower selection one
    step</b> icon again.</p>
    <p>Click off the artwork to deselect the wing. Select the black edge of
    the wing again. Press the &lt;Del&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; key again. If the
    black outline disappears, then good. Otherwise, repeat the previous few
    steps until you successfully delete the black outline.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the lower right wing with the Select tool (

    <li><p>With the wing selected, set its border stroke to black and its color
    to <b>none</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Duplicate the lower left wing with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D and make a
    mirror-image of it using the <b>FlipSelectedObjectsHorizontally</b> tool
    (<img src = "images/FlipSelectedObjectsHorizontallyIcon.gif" alt = "Flip
    selected objects horizontally icon" width = "26">).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move and rotate the duplicate transparent wing into place.</p>

      duplicate transparent wing into place" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Moving and rotating the duplicate transparent wing into
      place.</figcaption>
    </li>
    <li><p>The original wing with the black border and transparent fill lies
    underneath the colored wing in the image stack. With the colored wing
    selected (reselect it if you deselected it), click on the <b>Lower
    selection one step</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection one step
    icon" width = "26">) once or twice to put the colored wing underneath the
    black border. Click off the artwork to deselect the wing, then click on the
    black border and press the &lt;Del&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; key. If you
    accidentally delete the colored wing, then undo the mistake with
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z and repeat the previous couple of steps until you
    successfully delete the black border.</p>

    upper wings.</p>
    <p>Duplicate and move both upper wings to the left of the dragonfly. Make
    3 &times; 2 gradient meshes for both wings, color them with the original
    deep purple color, and give them the central highlight, just as you had

    <li>Can you add transparency to multiple objects?
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <header>
    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>You add transparency to an mesh gradient object just like adding
    transparency to any other object. Choose Objects &gt; Fill and
    Stroke&hellip;, click on the <b>Fill</b> tab, click on the <b>Mesh
    gradient</b> icon (<img src = "images/MeshGradientIcon.gif" alt = "Mesh
    gradient icon" width = "26">), and adjust the <b>Opacity (%)</b> bar to the
    percent opacity that you want.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Yes, you can group-select multiple objects using the marquee-select
    technique or by &lt;Shift&gt;-click on disparate objects. You then set the
    transparency for all the selected objects. They will all have the same
    degree of transparency.</p>
