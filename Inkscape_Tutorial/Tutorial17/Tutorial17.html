    <h2>Combining Artwork</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can combine Inkscape artwork with images from other graphics
  applications in a variety of ways for a wide range of creative results.
  Sharing artwork between applications lets you combine continuous-tone
  paintings and photographs with line art. Even though Inkscape lets you create
  certain types of raster images, Gimp and Photoshop excel at many image-editing
  tasks; once done, the images can then be placed in Inkscape.</p>
  <p>To illustrate how you can combine bitmap images with vector art and work
  between applications, this tutorial steps you through the process of creating
  a composite image. In this tutorial, you will add bitmap images created to a
  postcard created in Inkscape. Then you&rsquo;ll adjust the color in the photo,
  mask the photo, and sample color from the photo to use in the Inkscape
  artwork. You&rsquo;ll update a positioned image and then export your postcard
  to Gimp to complete the type treatment.</p>

    <h2>Vector Versus Bitmap Graphics</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Inkscape creates vector graphics, also called draw graphics, which are
  made up of shapes based on mathematical expressions. These graphics consist
  of clear, smooth lines that retain their crispness when scaled. They are
  appropriate for illustrations, type, and graphics, such as logos that may be
  scaled to different sizes.</p>
  <p><i>Bitmap images</i>, also called raster images, are based on a grid of
  pixels and are created by image-editing applications such as Gimp and Adobe
  Photoshop. In working with bitmap images, you edit groups of pixels rather
  than objects of shapes. Because bitmap graphics can represent subtle
  gradations of shade and color, they are appropriate for continuous-tone
  images such as photographs or artwork created in painting programs. A
  disadvantage of bitmap graphics is that they lose definition and appear
  jagged when scaled up. You can see the ragged the edges are in the rasterized
  image below.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/ChessLogoVector.gif" alt = "Vector art logo example" class =
    "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Logo drawn as vector art.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/ChessLogoRaster.gif" alt = "Bitmap art logo example"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Logo rasterized as bitmap art.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div class = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>In deciding whether to use Inkscape or a bitmap image program such as Gimp
  for creating and combining graphics, consider both the elements of the image
  and how the image will be used. In general, use Inkscape if you need to
  create art or type with clean lines that will look good at any magnification.
  In most cases, you will also want to use Inkscape for laying out a design,
  because Inkscape offers more flexibility in working with type and with
  reselecting, moving, and altering images. You can create raster images in
  Inkscape but its pixel-editing tools are limited. Use Gimp or Photoshop for
  images that need pixel-editing, color correcting, painting, and other special
  effects.</p>

        <figcaption>Tutorial 17 finished artwork.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork
    smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on-screen as you work. (Move
    the artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don&rsquo;t want to
    leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
    </li>
    <aside><p><b>Resource:</b> For an illustration of the finished artwork in
    this lesson, see the beginning of this page.</b></p>
    </aside>
    <li><p>Now download the starting art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/Tutorial17_start.svg"><b>Tutorial17_start.svg</b></a> and
    store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now you&rsquo;ll open the start file to begin the lesson.</p>
    <p>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial17_start.svg</b> file.</p>
    <p>The file has been prepared with three layers: the Text layer, and two
    additional layers: Layer 1 and Checkerboard, on which you&rsquo;ll place
    images. Checkerboard also contains objects that you&rsquo;ll make into a
    mask.</p>

    <h2>Importing an SVG (Scaled Vector Graphics) Image File</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll begin by placing an <i><b>SVG</b></i> &nbsp;image file in the
  Inkscape document as an embedded file. Imported files can be embedded or
  linked. Embedded files are added to the Inkscape file, and the Inkscape file
  size increases to reflect the addition of the imported file. Linked files
  remain as separate, external files, with a link to the imported file in the
  Inkscape file. (The linked file must always accompany the Inkscape file, or
  the link will break and the imported file will not appear in the Inkscape
  artwork.)</p>
  <p>Remember that <b>SVG</b> stands for <b>S</b>caled <b>V</b>ector
  <b>G</b>raphics which means that drawings are mathematical expressions that a
  graphics program, such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator&reg; can understand
  and render (that is, draw) precisely, no matter how large or small the artwork
  is.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the <b>Layers</b> icon (<img src = "images/LayersIcon.gif"
    alt = "Layers Icon" width = "26">) in the <b>Tool Controls Bar</b> to make
    the <b>Layers</b> dialog box active. Resize the dialog box to make all the
    layers visible if needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>In the <b>Layers</b> dialog box, select the Checkerboard layer.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectingCheckerboardLayer.gif" alt = "Selecting the
        Checkboard layer" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the Checkboard layer.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>When you import an image, it is added to the selected layer.
    You&rsquo;ll use the Checkerboard layer for the imported image, because the
    layer includes artwork for a mask for the image that you&rsquo;ll create
    later in the tutorial.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/Chess.svg"><b>Chess.svg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now choose File &gt; Import&hellip;</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When the <b>Select file to import</b> dialog box appears, navigate
    to the <b>Chess.svg</b> file, select it, and click on the <b>Open</b>
    button.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectFileToImportDialogBox.gif" alt = "Select file
        to import dialog box" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption><b>Select file to import</b> dialog box.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>SVG input</b> dialog box appears. Leave <b>DPI for rendered
    SVG</b> and <b>Image Rendering Mode</b> at their default settings.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SVGInputDialogBox.gif" alt = "SVG input dialog box"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption><b>SVG input</b> dialog box.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click the <b>OK</b> button. The image is imported onto the
    Checkerboard layer. In the figure below, it is placed at the upper left
    corner of the checkerboard. You can see that, like the checkerboard, the
    imported image of the chess pieces lies underneath the text, which lies in
    the Text layer above. It is as if you are working with tracing paper.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/BitmapFileImported.gif" alt = "Bitmap image file
        imported and placed in the Checkerboard layer" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Bitmap image file imported and placed in the Checkerboard
        layer.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The image you just imported contains two grouped components:
    the background chessboard and chess pieces, and a masked image of the chess
    Queen piece, cut out and positioned exactly ontop of the image of the Queen
    in the background image.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SVGInputFile.gif" alt = "SVG input file" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>SVG input file.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <li><p>Now you&rsquo;ll move the imported images, using <b>Snap</b> tools to
    place the image precisely.<p>
    <p>Make the <b>Snap Controls Bar</b> active. Choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt;
    Snap Controls Bar is it is not visible or has been iconified.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> (<img src =
    "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt = "Enable snapping icon" width = "26"
    >), <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> (<img src =
    "images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif" alt = "Snap bounding boxes icon" width =
    "26" >), and <b>Snap bounding box corners</b> (<img src =
    "images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt = "Snap bounding box corners
    icon" width = "26" >) icons.<p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click-drag the imported image until one of its corners coincides
    with its corresponding corner on the checkerboard image. The snap function
    will alert you when the image corner is close enough to an underlying corner
    to be snapped precisely into place. The square with dashed-line sides is an
    artifact of the positioning process.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/PositioningImportedImage.gif" alt = "Positioning the
        imported image" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Positioning the imported image.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now you will move the image below the checkerboard, and duplicate
    it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <aside><p><b>Importing Files</b></p>
  <p>The <b>Import</b> command places files from other applications into
  Inkscape. Files can be embedded, or included in, the Inkscape file, or they
  can be linked to the Inkscape file. Linked files remain independent of the
  Inkscape file, resulting in a smaller Inkscape file. Depending on a preference
  you set for updating links, the linked image in the Inkscape file may
  change when the artwork in the linked file changes.</p>
  <p>By default, the <b>Embed</b> option is selected in the <b>bitmap image
  import</b> dialog box which opens after you have selected your image file to
  import. If you deselect the <b>Link</b> option, the <b>Embed</b> option
  automatically activates and the artwork is embedded in the Inkscape file,
  resulting in a larger Inkscape file.</b>

    <h2>Duplicating an Imported Image</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can duplicate placed images just as you do other objects in an
  Inkscape file. The copy of the image can then be modified independently of
  the original.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Now you&rsquo;ll duplicate the Chess.svg image in the <b>Layers</b>
    palette and move it into its own layer.</p>
    <p>Click on the <b>Unlocked Layer</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/UnlockedLayerIcon.gif" alt = "Unlocked layer icon" width = "26">)
    for the <b>Text</b> layer to toggle it locked (<img src =
    "images/LockedLayerIcon.gif" alt = "Locked layer icon" width = "26">) so the
    text won&rsquo; be accidentally manipulated as you work.</p>
    <p>Make the <b>Checkerboard</b> layer the active layer, if it isn&rsquo;
    already, and click on the background image.</p>
      <figure>

    </li>
    <li><p>With the background image selected, press
    &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to ungroup the background image and the Queen
    chess piece image. Do <u>not</u> click on the Queen chess piece. The Queen
    chess piece is a separate image apart from the background and is to remain
    on the <b>Checkerboard</b> layer.</p>

    image. Don&rsquo;t select the Queen image. You will move only the
    background.</p>
    <li>
    <p>Choose Edit &gt; Duplicate to duplicate just the background.</p>
    </li>
  <li><p>Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgDn&gt; to move the background image down to

    <h2>Adjusting Color in a Bitmap Image</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You can use filters to modify colors in bitmap images in a variety of ways.
  You can use filters to convert to a different color mode (such as RGB, CMYK,
  or grayscale) or to adjust individual color values. You can also use filters
  to saturate or desaturate (darken or lighten) colors, or invert colors
  (create a color negative).</p>

    chessboard image in the Checkerboard layer. Later in this tutorial,
    you&rsquo;ll apply a mask to this image and then adjust colors in the Blue
    Chess layer so that the two layers appear in contrasting colors through the
    mask.</p>

    <h2>Masking an Image</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Masks crop part of an image so that only a portion of the image appears
  through the shape of the mask. You can make a mask from a single path or a
  compound path.</p>
  <h4>Creating Compound Path and Opacity Masks</h4>
  <p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll create a compound path from the checkerboard
  pattern on the Checkerboard layer and create an opacity mask from the
  compound path, so that the Background layer appears through the mask. Then
  you&rsquo;ll adjust the colors in the Blue Chess layer to contrast with the
  Background layer.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Click on the eye icon of all the layers in the <b>Layer</b> palette
    except for the <b>Checkerboard</b> layer.</p>

      selected" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>All black squares selected.</figcaption>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Path &gt; Object to Path. Right now you&rsquo; see no
    changes, but Inkscape no longer &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the squares as square
    objects but as a collection of paths and nodes.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Path &gt; Combine. The square paths have been merged into one
    compound path, which can be used as a mask.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/CombinePaths.gif" alt = "Combining paths" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Combining paths. Note that individual squares no longer
        have their own bounding boxes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p><b>Note:</b> the <b>Mask</b> function will work only when the mask is a
    single item, that is, a single object. You make separate individual objects
    into one either by grouping them using the <b>Group selected objects</b>
    function or by converting the objects into paths and then using the
    <b>Combine</b> paths function.</p>
    <p>Combined paths act just like grouped objects. The only difference lies
    behind the scenes. Inkscape still &ldquo;sees&rdquo; grouped objects as,
    indeed single objects that have been collected together to form a compound
    entity in which all of its components are still recognized as squares,
    circles, and other shapes that will still have their shape identity if that
    group is ungrouped &mdash; you will get all of your original shapes back
    again.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, objects that have been converted into paths have lost
    all of their shape attributes and are &ldquo;seen&rdquo; only as collections
    of lines, curves, and nodes. When combined into a single compound path, that
    entity is still a collection of lines, curves, and nodes. Combined paths can
    be broken apart using the <b>Break apart</b> path function, but the result
    is still a collection of lines, curves, and nodes, but with no shape
    information.</p>
    <p>Path effect functions work on paths. Some of these functions first
    convert an object with shape information into a path because that is how
    they work. They won&rsquo;t work on objects containing shape information.
    That is simply how those functions have been put together. Yet, you can
    manipulate those converted objects in ways that you can&rsquo;t with
    regular shape tools.</p>

    <h4>Editing a Masked Image</h4>
  </header>
  <p>The contrast between the blue and yellow squares of the background is low.
  The focus of the card is supposed to be on the Queen chess piece &mdash; the
  title of the card is, after all, &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Gambit.&rdquo; It
  makes sense to have the background more subdued in comparison with the
  coloration of the Queen and highlight the Queen so that she &ldquo;pops&rdquo;
  visually out of the picture.</p>
  <p>

    <h2>Exploring on Your Own</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now that you know how to import, mask, and apply color filters to an image
  in an Inkscape file, you can import other images and apply a variety of
  modifications to them. You can also create masks for images from objects you
  create in Inkscape. For more practice, try the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Repeat the tutorial by making a copy of the Chess.svg file, call it
    <b>Chess2.svg</b>. In addition to adjusting color in the component images,
    apply transformation effects, such as shearing or rotating, or filters or
    effects, such as one of the extension Distort filters/effects, to create
    stylistic contrast between the two images in the checkerboard pattern.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the basic shapes tools or the drawing tools to draw objects to
    create a compound path to use as a mask. Then place the Chess.svg image
    into the file with the compound path, and apply the compound path as a
    mask.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create large type and use the type as a mask to mask a placed
    object.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <li>Describe the difference between linking and embeding a placed file in
    Inkscape.
    </li>
    <li>How do you create an opacity mask for an imported image?
    </li>
    <li>What kinds of objects can be used as masks?
    </li>
    <li>What color modifications can you apply to a selected object using

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>A linked file is a separate, external file connected to the Inkscape
    file by an electronic link. A linked file does not add significantly to the
    size of the Inkscape file. The linked file <u>must</u> accompany the
    Inkscape file to preserve the link and ensure that the imported file appears
    in the Inkscape file.</p>
    <p>An embedded file is included in the Inkscape file. The Inkscape file size
    reflects the addition of the embedded file. Because the embedded file is
    part of the Inkscape file, there is no link to break.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You create an opacity mask by placing the object to be used as a
    mask on top of the object to be masked. Then you select the mask and the
    objects to be masked, and choose Object &gt; Mask &gt; Set.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>A mask can be a simple or compound path. You can use type as a mask.
    You can import opacity masks with from Gimp and Photoshop. You can also
    create layer clipping masks with any shape that is the topmost object of a
    group or layer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can use filters to change the color mode (RGB, CMYK, HSL, HSV, or
    Grayscale) or adjust individual colors in a selected object. You can also
    saturate or desaturate colors or invert colors in a selected object. You
    can apply color modifications to placed images, as well as to artwork
    created in Inkscape.</p>
