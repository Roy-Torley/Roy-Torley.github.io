  <h2>Prepping for this tutorial</h2>
</header>

<ol>
  <li>Start Inkscape.</li>

  <li><p>Download file
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/Tutorial03Image01.svg"><b>Tutorial03Image01.svg</b></a>
  to your computer.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/FinishedProduct.gif"
      alt = "Logo image file for Tutorial 3"
      class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>If you like, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Zoom Out
  (<b>-</b>) to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size,
  and leave it on your screen as you work. Move the artwork where you want it
  in the window using the &lt;Shift&gt;+arrow keys. If you don't want to leave
  the image open, choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>C</u>lose.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now create the start file to begin the lesson.</p>

<ol start = "4" >
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>N</u>ew to open a new, untitled
  document.</p></li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s&hellip;, name the file
  <b>Logo</b>, and navigate to the folder where you want to store the file
  using the Save In menu. Leave the default file format as <b>Inkscape SVG

  <h2>Setting up the Document</h2>
</header>
<p>You&rsquo;ll begin this tutorial by</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>displaying a grid to use as a guideline for drawing,</p></li>
    <li><p>setting the ruler units to inches,</p></li>
    <li><p>closing the color palette and Command toolbar that you won&rsquo;t
    use,</p></li>
    <li><p>opening the Snap Controls bar to adjust the positioning of
    objects.</p></li>
    <li><p>Close the color palette by pressing &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p or
    choosing View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Palette. To close the Commands toolbar,
    choose View &gt; Show/Hide &lt; Commands Bar. For now, you won&rsquo;t need
    to use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose View &gt; Page Grid to display a grid that&rsquo;s useful for
  measuring, drawing, and aligning shapes. The grid won&rsquo;t print with the
  artwork.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the rulers are not visible along the top and left side of the
  window, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Rulers to display them. The ruler
  units are set by default to pixels.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can change ruler units for the current document. The ruler unit of
measure applies to measuring objects, moving and transforming objects, setting
grid and guide spacing, and creating ellipses and rectangles. (It does not
affect the units in the Character, Paragraph, and Stroke palettes.)
</p>

  the right side of the window by choosing <u>V</u>iew&gt; Default.</p>
  <p>When Inkscape is launched, the Snap Controls Bar is activated
  automatically. Snapping in the figure above is enabled. If you need to
  deactivate it to prevent automatic snapping of objects to anything, click on
  the topmost (or leftmost) icon in the bar (<b>Enable snapping (%)</b>). All
  subordinate icons will also deactivate. We&rsquo;ll discuss more about the
  Snap Controls Bar later.</p>

  <h2>Using Basic Shape Tools</h2>
</header>
<p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll create a simple logo using the basic shape
tools in the toolbox. The shape tools include the:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Create rectangles and squares tool</b> (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif"
  alt = "Create Squares tool"  width = "26" >),</li>
  <li><b>Create circles, ellipses, and arcs tool</b> (<img src = "images/EllipseTool.gif" alt = "Create Circles tool" width = "26" >), and</li>
  <li><b>Create stars and polygons tool</b> (<img src = "images/CreateStarsTool.gif" alt = "Create Stars tool" width = "26" >).</li>
</ul>
<aside><p>To reduce bulky prose, we&rsquo;ll call these tools the Rectangle
tool, Ellipse tool, and Polygon or Star tool, respectively.</p>
</aside>

  <a href = "#Top"><img src = "images/BackToTop.png" alt = "Back to Top link"
  class = "img-fluid"></a>
<header>
  <h2>Drawing the Pencil Shape</h2>
</header>
<p>In Inkscape, you control the thickness and color of lines that you draw by
setting stroke attributes. A stroke is the paint characteristics of a line or
the outline of an object. A fill is the paint characteristics of the inside of
an object. The default settings will let you see the objects you draw with a
white fill and a black outline.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Select the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom
    tool" width = "26">)
  in the toolbox, and click in the middle of the window once or twice until you
  are zoomed in to about 150%. (Notice that 150%, more or less, is displayed
  in the bottom left corner of the window.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; G<u>u</u>ides to turn them on. <b>Guides</b>
  automatically snap the edges of objects to nearby objects or their intersect
  points as you move them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<a href = "#Top"><img src = "images/BackToTop.png" alt = "Back to Top link"
class = "img-fluid"></a>

<aside>
  <header>
    <h2>How Guides Work</h2>
  </header>
  <p>When the <b>Guides</b> feature is turned on and you move the cursor over
  your artwork, the cursor looks for objects, page boundaries, and
  intersections of construction guides to snap to that are within the tolerance
  range set in <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>D</u>ocument Properties &gt; Snap tab.</p>

  <p>You can use <b>Guides</b> in the following ways when you create, move, and
  transform objects.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you create an object with the pen or shape tools, use the
    <b>Guides</b> to position the new object&rsquo;s anchor points relative to
    the other object.
    </li>
    <li>When you move an object, use the <b>Guides</b> to align to the point on
    the object that you have selected. You can align to the anchor point at the
    corner of a selected object near the bounding box. To do so, select the
    object just inside the bounding box handle. If the tolerance is 5 pixels or
    greater, you can snap to the corner point from 5 pixels away.
    </li>
    <li>When you transform an object, <b>Guides</b> appear to assist the
    transformation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: When <b>Snap to Grid</b> is turned on, you cannot use
  <b>Guides</b> (even if the menu command is selected).</p>
  </aside>

<ol start = "3">
  <li><p>Select the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif"
  alt = "Create Squares tool" width = "26" >), and drag it to draw a rectangle
  that's 0.75 inches wide and 1 inch tall. (Use the rulers and the grid as
  guides.) This will be the body of the pencil.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DrawRectangle1.png" alt = "Drawing a rectangle"
    width = "300" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Drag to draw first rectangle</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p>When you release the left mouse button, the rectangle is
automatically selected and eight sizing handles appear on its bounding box.
To move the rectangle, you will need to put the cursor on the border of the
rectangle and then drag it to its new location. Trying to move it by dragging
on its interior will have no effect unless it has a color fill.</p>
</aside>

<ol start = "4">
  <li><p>Note the rectangle&rsquo;s width (<b>W</b>) and height (<b>H</b>) in
  the Tool Controls bar: <img src = "images/HeightWidthInfo.gif"
  alt = "Height and width info" class = "img-fluid"></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If the rectangle&rsquo;s dimensions are not correct, it&rsquo;s easy
  to change them. Click on the rectangle&rsquo;s border if it isn't still
  selected. Then, click in the <b>W</b> (width) box and change the measurement
  to <b>.75</b>. Do the same with the <b>H</b> (height) box, changing the
  measurement to <b>1</b>. The rectangle&rsquo;s dimensions will update
  accordingly.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll draw another rectangle centered inside the first one to
  represent the two vertical lines on the pencil.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the Rectangle tool still selected, position the pointer over the
  center point of the rectangle, hold down the &lt;Shift&gt; key, and drag out
  from the center point to draw a rectangle that's centered inside it. Release
  the mouse button when the rectangle is the same height as the first rectangle
  (1 inch). If the unit of measurement is not in inches (<b>in</b>), click in
  that box and choose <b>in</b> from the drop-down menu. In the width
  (<b>W</b>) box, change the measurement to 0.42 so the inner rectangle
  won&rsquo;t appear unnecessarily broad.</p>
  <p>Holding down &lt;Shift&gt; as you drag the Rectangle tool draws the
  rectangle from its center point rather than from its top left corner.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DrawRectangle2.png" alt = "Drawing a rectangle"
    width = "300" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>&lt;Shift&gt;-drag to draw second rectangle</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>The inner rectangle is &half; an inch in width. It makes the pencil
  look overly broad. Click in the width (<b>W</b>) box and change the
  width to <b>0.42</b> (make sure the unit of measurement is <b>in</b>).</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/InnerRectangle0.42.gif" alt = "Drawing a rectangle"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Inner rectangle width changed to 0.42 in.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
</ol>
  <p>The inner rectangle needs to be centered inside the outer rectangle.
  The <b>Snap centers of objects</b> tool (<img src =
  "images/SnapToObjectCenterTool.gif" alt = "Snap centers of objects tool"
  width = "26" >) will allow us to do centering easily.</p>
<ol start = "8">
  <li>
  <p>Click on the Snap to object center tool to activate it (<img src =
  "images/SnapToObjectCenterToolActive.gif"
  alt = "Snap centers of objects tool"  width = "26" >)
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the border of the inner rectangle with the Select tool
  (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >)
  to select it. Drag the inner rectangle until you see the tool tip indicating
  that the rectangle will now snap into place.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/CenteringRectangles.gif" alt = "Centering the inner and
    outer rectangles" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Inner rectangle snapping into place.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Release the mouse and click off the rectangle to deselect it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you'll create a rounded rectangle for the eraser using the Node
  tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Node tool" width = "26">).</p>

<ol start = "11">
  <li><p>Choose the Rectangle tool and create a 0.75 in &times; 0.75 in square
  using the grid lines to snap the figure into a good position. Leave the
  square selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif"
  alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >).</p>
</li>
  <li><p>Left click on the circular handle on the upper right corner of the
  square and drag it down by one grid square. Release the mouse button. Left
  click on the second circular handle that is still on the upper right corner
  of the square and drag it over to the left by one grid square. All four
  corners of the square are now rounded.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src = "images/RoundSquareCorners.gif" alt = "Rounded square corners"
  class = "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Drag one circular handle down one grid square length and then the
  second to the left to round all four square corners.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You will now snap the eraser shape to the top of the pencil body.</p>
<ol start = "14">
  <li><p>If the Snap Controls Bar is not displayed, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt;
  Show/H<u>i</u>de &gt; Snap Controls Bar to display it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26">) if it is not already selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the edge of the rounded square to select it.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click on the Enable snapping button at the far left of the Snap
  Controls bar (<img src = "images/EnableSnappingOff.gif"
  alt = "Enable snapping button" width = "26" >) to activate the snapping
  function.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Snap bounding boxes button which is the next button to
  the right of the Enable snapping button. It looks identical to the Enable
  snapping button but has a different tool tip description.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Snap midpoints of bounding box edges button (<img src =
  "images/SnapMidpointsOfBoundingBoxEdges.gif" alt = "Snap midpoints of
  bounding box edges button" width = "26" >).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the rounded square shape until it is close to the top of the
  pencil body and release the left mouse button. The eraser shape immediately
  shifts into place squarely on the top of the pencil body. If you under- or
  overshoot, just drag the eraser into place and see the pulling action of the
  snapping function.</p>

  <img src = "images/SnappingEraserToPencilBody.gif"
  alt = "Snapping the eraser to the pencil body"
  class = "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Result</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Next you&rsquo;ll create two shapes to represent the metal bands connecting
  the eraser to the pencil.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To prevent automatic snapping to a grid line that will misalign your
  objects, click on the Snap to grids button (<img src =
  "images/SnapToGrids.gif" alt = "Snap to grids button" width = "26" >) to turn
  the feature off. Keep the other snapping features on because they will help
  in aligning objects properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To make the first band, create a rounded box 1 square high and 8
  squares long. Note that the corners are already rounded because the
  rounding function carries over into your next created rectangle or square.</p>

  <h2>Drawing the Piece of Stationery</h2>
</header>
<p>You can draw the diamond-shaped piece of stationery for the logo in a couple
of ways. One way is to draw four-sided polygons (using the same methods you
used to draw the triangle for the pencil tip). Another way is to draw using
the Rectangle tool, and the Selection tool.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Select the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif"
  alt = "Rectangle tool" width = "26" >) in the toolbox, and position the
  pointer over the center point of the pencil body. Hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and
  drag the tool to draw a square of any size from the center of the pencil.</p>
  <p>Holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key while dragging the Rectangle tool
  constrains the rectangle to a square. Holding down &lt;Shift&gt; draws
  the rectangle from its center point rather than from the top left corner.
  Holding down both the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys allows you to
  draw a square from its center point out.</p>

  <h2>Copying and Scaling Shapes</h2>
</header>
<p>A final step in creating logos is to scale the artwork to a 1-inch square
and make sure that the resized logo still presents a clear image. You&rsquo;ll
use the bounding box feature in Inkscape to make a scaled copy of the logo.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Double-click in the Zoom text box in the lower right-hand corner of
  the window to highlight its contents and type in <b>100</b> to zoom out to
  100% magnification.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
  alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >), select the bottom right corner point
  of the bounding box, hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt;, and drag the corner up and to

<ol>
  <li>The basic shape tools are the Rectangle tool, Circle tool, Polygon tool,
  and the Spiral tool.
  </li>
  <li>Select the Rectangle tool, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;, and drag to create the
  square.
  </li>
  <li>Select your object and, while the object is still selected, click on the
  desired color in the Color palette. The interior of the object is colored
  with that particular color. The stroke color is not affected.
  </li>
  <li>Select your object and, while the object is still selected,
  &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the desired color in the Color palette. The exterior
  boundary of the object is colored with that particular color. The fill color
  is not affected.
  </li>
  <li>The View grid acts as a guiding tool that you can use for precision
  placement of an object, including snapping. The View grid does not print with
  the artwork. A grid made with the Grid extension tool does print.
  </li>
  <li>To rescale an object proportionately, hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and
  click-drag with the mouse to resize.
  </li>
